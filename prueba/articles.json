But for How Long?","Latest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak and the Economy"],"story":"Even as the coronavirus pandemic appears to recede in New York, corporations have been reluctant to call their workers back to their skyscrapers and are showing even more reticence about committing to the city long term.Fewer than 10 percent of New York’s office workers had returned as of last month and just a quarter of major employers expect to bring their people back by the end of the year, according to a new survey. Only 54 percent of these companies say they will return by July 2021.Demand for office space has slumped. Lease signings in the first eight months of the year were about half of what they were a year earlier. That is putting the office market on track for a 20-year low for the full year. When companies do sign, many are opting for short-term contracts that most landlords would have rejected in February.At stake is New York’s financial health and its status as the world’s corporate headquarters. There is more square feet of work space in the city than in London and San Francisco combined, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate brokerage firm. Office work makes up the cornerstone of New York’s economy and property taxes from office buildings account for nearly 10 percent of the city’s total annual tax revenue.What is most unnerving is that a recovery could unfold much more slowly than it did after the Sept. 11 attacks and the financial crisis of 2008. That’s largely because the pandemic has prompted companies to fundamentally rethink their real estate needs.ImageLess than 10 percent of workers had returned to New York’s skyscrapers as of last month, according to a survey by the Partnership for New York.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York TimesRobert Ivanhoe, a real estate lawyer at Greenberg Traurig, said he had about 20 clients that had postponed searches for new offices. “They are putting a lot of thought into coming up with a new operating model — how much of my work force is going to work from home and for how much time?” he said. “It has never been turned upside down like this before.”Real estate data confirms that. The number of office leases signed from January through August totaled 13.7 million square feet, less than half as much as the first eight months of last year, according to Colliers International, a real estate brokerage firm. By contrast, leasing hit an 18-year high at the end of last year with nearly 43 million square feet of new leases and renewals.“When it comes to making decisions about office leases, the words are postpone, adjourn and delay,” said Ruth Colp-Haber, the chief executive of Wharton Property Advisors, a real estate brokerage firm.Executives at the meal delivery company Freshly were ready to sign a lease for 50,000 square feet of office space at 2 Park Avenue, a stately, 29-story Art Deco tower in Midtown, in March.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Latest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak and the Economy\n  \n  \n  \n    4h ago\n    The latest: Under Armour announces layoffs, and Luby’s will liquidate.\n  \n    4h ago\n    Lululemon reports a quarterly profit as consumers flock to yoga pants.\n  \n    6h ago\n    The work-from-home challenge for employees of color.\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    See more updates\n  \n  \n    More live coverage:\n    \n      Global\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the coronavirus abruptly shut New York down for several months, and the company “hit pause” on its expansion, said Michael Wystrach, Freshly’s founder and chief executive. The company is still considering new office space, but he isn’t sure when it would sign a lease. “We are long-term believers in New York City.”During any weekday in Midtown, the sidewalks are as empty as they usually are on a Sunday, underscoring how few employees have returned. In August, a survey of major employers by the Partnership for New York found only 8 percent of employees had returned to the office and most expected to bring employees back by next summer, and another quarter of them had not decided when they would return.Elected officials, real estate tycoons and even Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian, have issued paeans to New York’s resilience, arguing that city has a history of bouncing back.

They contend that companies will tell most employees to stay away until a vaccine is widely distributed and perhaps for much longer.Which of those two visions is closer to being right will help determine how quickly New York regains its energy, economic health and tax revenue.Investors are not expecting a quick recovery. Shares of companies with lots of New York office space like Empire State Realty Trust, which owns the Empire State Building, and SL Green Realty, which owns the immense new One Vanderbilt tower next to Grand Central Terminal, have plunged this year.“I think the New York office market is going to be generally challenged for the next three to five years,” said Jonathan Litt, the founder of the hedge fund Land & Buildings. His fund published a report in May on why it thinks the shares of Empire State Realty Trust are overvalued.A big part of the problem is that many companies are holding off on new leases.In recent years, the biggest renters of office space have been co-working companies like WeWork, New York’s largest private tenant. Such businesses signed nearly 8 percent of new leases in Manhattan last year and 12 percent in 2018, according to Cushman & Wakefield. But co-working companies are in distress and some may not survive.Other potential renters of offices are unsure what to do or are waiting for landlords to reduce rents, factoring in incentives like rent-free months and cash for office improvements. “What’s the point of signing a lease with a 15 percent decrease in rent if you think it’s going to go lower?” said Michael Colacino, the president of the brokerage firm SquareFoot.ImageThere were far fewer people on 5th Avenue one recent Friday afternoon than before the pandemic.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York TimesSome companies with leases that are ending this year or next appear to be kicking the can down the road, signing short-term extensions rather than committing to typical deals that last several years. In recent weeks, NBC Universal extended a lease for a secondary office at 1221 Avenue of Americas and the Stroock & Stroock & Lavan law firm did the same for its office downtown. But they both did so for just a year, according to Colliers. A spokeswoman for NBC Universal declined to comment and Stroock & Stroock did not return a call and multiple emails.In normal times, owners of large office buildings would typically not entertain a one- or two-year lease extension for a large tenant, said Franklin Wallach, senior managing director of the New York Research Group at Colliers. “They see that new leasing activity has dropped off while the amount of sublet space coming into the market is on the rise, so the average landlord wants to keep the tenant in the building.”One of the biggest concerns is that companies could soon start trying to sublease hundreds of thousands of square feet of space that they are not planning to use anytime soon. For companies seeking offices, sublets often provide a shorter lease at a steep discount to market prices.Starr Insurance Companies, which is led by Maurice R. Greenberg, is seeking to sublet 190,000 square feet that it leases at 399 Park Avenue, according to Colliers. And First Republic Bank, which signed a 211,521-square-foot lease last April for 410 Tenth Avenue, put 151,000 square feet up for sublet, according to a report from the real estate broker Savills. Spokesmen for Starr and First Republic declined to comment.Sublet space made up about a quarter of the total office space available in New York at the end of the second quarter, according to Savills, and many real estate brokers said they expected that to increase in the coming months.In January, Ms. Colp-Haber was showing offices to a construction company that she said was in the market for a five-year lease in Manhattan. Last month, the company signed a sublet for one year at a 40 percent discount to the original lease, she said.Still, property owners claim not to be overly worried because most tenants are paying their rent. They point out that office leases last for years and are very difficult to end early. And large financial firms, among the biggest tenants in New York, aren’t stressed as they were in the last recession.ImageLandlords point out that most companies are paying their rent and office leases tend to last several years and are very hard to end early.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York TimesThe most optimistic sign that New York’s office market will bounce back quickly is that big technology companies, which are gaining ground, are scarfing up square feet. Facebook in early August leased all of the office space — 730,000 square feet — in the Farley Post Office next to Penn Station. Amazon acquired the former Lord & Taylor building on Fifth Avenue in March from WeWork.Retail tenants in Hudson Yards, the sprawling development on the Far West Side of Manhattan, may be reeling, but companies are still moving in to the project’s office buildings.“They still believe New York is the place to have their business and grow their business,” said William C. Rudin, chief executive of Rudin Management Company. “The Amazon commitment is amazing; the Facebook commitment is amazing.”Some landlords see encouraging signs in their office buildings in the suburbs, where social distancing is easier because people tend to commute by cars. This, they argue, suggests that employers and workers want to return to the office and more of them will make their way back to New York, too.Anthony E. Malkin, chief executive of the Empire State Realty Trust, which owns the Empire State Building, said the number of people coming into his office buildings in Connecticut in mid-August was 40 percent of what it was a year earlier, and up from next to nothing in the spring because of the strict lockdown policies in place at the time. “That is a very high number and it’s growing.”"},{"address":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/business/economy/new-york-office-space-coronavirus.html","image":["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/08/business/00office-spaces-grid/00office-spaces-grid-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/08/business/00office-space6/merlin_176318631_2471a7d3-fced-4d5c-ae5f-798e0f3dc547-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"],"title":["Manhattan’s Office Buildings Are Empty.

Malkin, chief executive of the Empire State Realty Trust, which owns the Empire State Building, said the number of people coming into his office buildings in Connecticut in mid-August was 40 percent of what it was a year earlier, and up from next to nothing in the spring because of the strict lockdown policies in place at the time. “That is a very high number and it’s growing.”"},{"address":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/business/boeing-787-dreamliner.html","image":["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/08/business/08boeing2/merlin_176740287_c51074b7-cb32-426c-a818-7ec55708862e-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-niraj-chokshi/author-niraj-chokshi-thumbLarge.jpg"],"title":"Boeing 787 Dreamliner Deliveries Slowed by Quality Concerns","story":"Boeing said Tuesday that it expected deliveries of its popular 787 Dreamliner to be delayed as it and the Federal Aviation Administration look into quality control concerns with the plane, a wide-body jet capable of carrying hundreds of passengers long distances.Last month, the company said it had grounded eight planes already in service for inspection and repair after finding that it had fallen short of its manufacturing standards. On Tuesday, Boeing said it had identified another failure to abide by its own guidelines during production of a horizontal stabilizer, though it said there was no immediate safety risk.“We are taking time to thoroughly inspect completed 787s to ensure that they are free of the issues and meet all engineering specifications prior to delivery,” the company said in a statement. “We expect these inspections to affect the timing of 787 deliveries in the near-term.”Boeing said the new problem stemmed from excess force in assembling components of the stabilizer at its Salt Lake City facility and could affect the part’s life span. A total of 893 airplanes are believed to be affected, the company said, and it is examining whether repairs are needed on any jets now in service.The Federal Aviation Administration is also investigating the company for manufacturing flaws related to the plane.“The agency continues to engage with Boeing,” the agency said on Monday. “It is too early to speculate about the nature or extent of any proposed airworthiness directives that might arise.”Boeing shares fell nearly 6 percent on Tuesday after The Wall Street Journal, citing agency documents, reported that the F.A.A. was considering requiring deeper inspections of most of the approximately 1,000 Dreamliners delivered since 2011.The Dreamliner is a star of Boeing’s lineup, a relatively fuel-efficient twin-aisle airplane suited to international service. The jet’s biggest customers include All Nippon Airways, United Airlines, Japan Airlines, American Airlines, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Air Canada.Production concerns with the plane are longstanding. More than a year ago, a review by The New York Times of hundreds of internal and federal records and interviews with current and former staff members found a culture that emphasized speed over quality at Boeing’s plant in North Charleston, S.C., one of two where the Dreamliner is produced. The other is in Everett, Wash.In some cases, employee concerns were brushed aside as the company sought to cut long manufacturing delays, the investigation of the South Carolina plant found. In addition, Boeing’s practices had attracted the scrutiny of regulators and its own airline customers. Qatar Airways, for example, had stopped accepting planes from the factory. Nearly a dozen workers had filed complaints with federal regulators. And last month, the F.A.A. proposed fining Boeing $1.25 million for failing to protect the independence of the agency’s representatives at the plant.The concerns over Dreamliner production follow those raised about the Boeing 737 Max, which has been grounded since March 2019 after 346 people were killed in a pair of fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. This year, the House Transportation Committee’s Democratic majority accused Boeing of overlooking safety in the interest of meeting manufacturing goals for the Max and said the F.A.A. too willingly yielded to Boeing’s influence.After a long review, the agency said last month that Boeing had “effectively mitigated” defects in the Max, potentially clearing the way for the plane to fly again this winter.Many of the Boeing Dreamliners are grounded as air travel remains deeply depressed. Worldwide, domestic traffic fell 58 percent in July compared with the same month last year, according to the International Air Transport Association, an industry group. International demand was down 92 percent.That month, Boeing said it was slashing production of the jet as its airline customers struggled to deal with the deep decline in travel. It also announced that it would study consolidating work on the plane at one plant, a move that the machinists union in Washington has criticized as a smoke screen to move operations to South Carolina, where workers are not unionized.The study “may simply be masking a decision that is already made,” Jon Holden, president of the union, District 751 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said in a recent newsletter to members. The editorial board of The Seattle Times called on Washington’s governor to prevent such a move.Between the Max crisis and the pandemic, Boeing’s business has been buffeted this year. Through August, the company lost a net 378 orders, the company said Tuesday. It gained a net 54 orders last year and 893 in 2018."},{"address":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/business/boeing-787-dreamliner.html","image":["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/08/business/08boeing2/merlin_176740287_c51074b7-cb32-426c-a818-7ec55708862e-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/multimedia/author-niraj-chokshi/author-niraj-chokshi-thumbLarge.jpg"],"title":"Boeing 787 Dreamliner Deliveries Slowed by Quality Concerns","story":"Boeing said Tuesday that it expected deliveries of its popular 787 Dreamliner to be delayed as it and the Federal Aviation Administration look into quality control concerns with the plane, a wide-body jet capable of carrying hundreds of passengers long distances.Last month, the company said it had grounded eight planes already in service for inspection and repair after finding that it had fallen short of its manufacturing standards.

Fed Enabled a Record Expansion. Trump Is Taking Credit.","Our 2020 Election Guide","Joe Biden","Donald Trump"],"story":"WASHINGTON — President Trump is using the prepandemic economy to make a case for his re-election, highlighting time and again that unemployment rates fell to record low levels for Black and Hispanic workers in 2019, and that wages were climbing steadily under his watch.He is also seeking to convince voters that he is rapidly returning America to that prosperous place following waves of pandemic-wrought job loss — fostering what he labeled a “Super V” rebound on Sunday — and that Joseph R. Biden Jr. would “destroy” the economy if he wins in November.But Mr. Trump’s story line about his economic track record, particularly what he showcased during his Republican National Convention speech last month, leaves out a crucial detail. Lucky timing and a patient Federal Reserve was pivotal in driving the strong labor market of the late 2010s, economists said. The Trump administration’s tax cuts and higher government spending temporarily nudged the economy, but the trade wars cooled it off, so the administration’s track record was mixed.That complicated reality is unlikely to stop Mr. Trump from laying claim to the successes of the 2018 and 2019 job market. But voters who want to understand what drove such strong hiring and growth might be better off looking at the actions of the Fed and its chair, Jerome H. Powell, whom Mr. Trump nominated in late 2017 and then spent more than a year attacking on Twitter and in speeches.By retaining his predecessor’s patient approach to rate increases — and then stopping them altogether as inflation, which the central bank tries to keep under control, hovered at low levels — Mr. Powell’s Fed helped to keep the longest economic expansion in United States history chugging along. The stretch of unbroken growth pushed unemployment to its lowest level in 50 years, prompting companies to cast a wider net for employees, pulling long-sidelined workers back into jobs.“Both monetary and fiscal policy were stimulative, and it did lead to a strong labor market,” said Stephanie Aaronson, a former Fed researcher who is now at the Brookings Institution. Very low inflation “has given policymakers the latitude to try new things.”That matters as more than a talking point: It could fundamentally shape the post-pandemic economy. The Fed has signaled that it intends to leave rates low to push unemployment down again, which could help return the labor market to strong levels. But the challenges posed by business closures and job reshuffling mean that elected officials, who have taxing and spending powers that the Fed lacks, may prove crucial to the speed and scope of the rebound.“The single most important thing we can do here is to support a strong labor market,” Mr. Powell said in late August remarks. “That is more of an all-governmental society project,” and “to wait to the eighth and ninth year of the cycle to get those results — we can do better than that with other policies.”To be sure, it is easy to overstate how strong conditions were before the pandemic struck.About 83 percent of adults in their prime working years were in the labor force at the start of 2020, which was a marked improvement but still down from an 84.6 percent high in the late 1990s. Inequality prevailed. Wage growth had picked up from the expansion’s early years, but it remained shy of historical records.But there is no doubt that the prepandemic job market was robust. Unemployment had declined to 3.5 percent, its lowest level in half a century. Prime-age workers who had dropped out of the labor market were surprising economists by applying for jobs. Unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers hit record lows, and pay was picking up for those who earned the least.Now, the pandemic recession has thrown millions out of work, hitting disadvantaged groups especially hard. Black unemployment stood at 13 percent in August, for instance, compared to 7.3 percent for white workers.ImagePresident Trump is trying to take credit for the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years without acknowledging the role of the Fed.Credit...Stefani Reynolds for The New York TimesMr. Trump is already taking a victory lap as the job market begins to heal, calling the rebound “the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history” during a Sunday news conference. But about half of the people who have lost jobs since February remain unemployed. Economists have warned that the return to full strength could become a grinding process, and Mr. Powell has said that some workers may struggle to return to jobs.Understanding the policy mix that helped make the labor market so strong in 2019 will be critical to putting the United States back on track for another robust period of growth.Some of the policies pushed through by Mr. Trump and lawmakers did help to bolster economic growth, which can drive hiring, economists said. The government was spending more freely, and the administration’s signature tax cuts, passed in late 2017, seem to have delivered a fleeting jolt to the economy.Economists at the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model say that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act helped growth to jump to about 3 percent for 2018, but the effect faded as growth returned to 2.2 percent in 2019.“We don’t project any material impact on growth from T.C.J.A. in 2019 or going forward,” said Alexander Arnon, a senior analyst at the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a research center that analyzes and predicts the effects of tax and other policy changes on the federal budget.Data make it clear that the administration’s policies were not the whole story.A chart of employment gains over the expansion show that they continued with remarkable consistency, month over month and year after year, starting from around 2010. The jobless rate slowly and steadily dropped. And people gradually trickled back from the labor market’s sidelines.Much of the improvement seems to have been driven by a long, steady economic expansion, creating a self-sustaining cycle in which workers got hired, spent more and fueled demand that created more jobs.Fed policy helped to enable the progress. Starting under Mr. Powell’s predecessor Janet L. Yellen, the central bank chose to lift interest rates at a historically slow pace, treading carefully to avoid crashing the expansion while also trying to avoid runaway inflation.Mr. Powell, who assumed the Fed chair in February 2018, raised rates four times during his first year — still a much slower pace than in prior business cycles — before pausing in early 2019 as markets gyrated. Under his watch, the central bank allowed the unemployment rate to fall to recent lows without trying to offset that change, and even lowered interest rates in the second half of 2019 to help sustain the expansion amid Mr. Trump’s trade war, which included steep tariffs on Chinese goods.Mr. Trump himself was publicly pushing for rate cuts, viewing that as a way to make the economy take off like a “rocket.” He regularly criticized Mr. Powell for the 2018 rate increases and then the slow pace of 2019 rate cuts. The president implied that Mr. Powell was an “enemy” and called the Fed chair and his colleagues “boneheads” for not pursuing easier monetary policy sooner.But the Fed sets rates independently of the White House and consistently ignored his advice. When it did move, it neither did so at the speed the president sought, nor by using the emergency monetary tools that he wanted.The good news for the post-crisis recovery and rebound is that the Fed is likely to again let unemployment fall sharply.In an update to its long-run framework in late August, the Fed officially signaled that it will no longer raise interest rates because of a low unemployment rate alone, effectively codifying the practice adopted last year. The bad news is that the central bank is low on ammunition to prod the economy. It was able to cut interest rates by only 1.5 percentage points when the pandemic started, compared to cuts that totaled about 5 percent during the prior two recessions. Relying too much on low rates could make for another very gradual recovery — one like the last long expansion, which took nearly a decade to really pull workers in from the sidelines. “We really need it to be broader than just the Fed,” Mr. Powell said of post-pandemic labor market policies, speaking at the Kansas City Fed’s conference in late August.Mr. Trump and his allies are correct in arguing that leadership from the White House could matter enormously. Government taxing and spending will be paramount to the strength of the coming business cycle.“President Trump and a President Biden would pursue different fiscal policy paths,” said Michael Strain, who studies economic policy at the American Enterprise Institute. “There might also be differences in how they pursue the public health situation.”Most economists argue that more government spending will be important to keeping America on a path toward full recovery. There is less agreement over shutdown versus reopening: Some stress the primacy of controlling the virus, while others argue that the costs to business and jobs are too steep.“There are a lot of unknowns,” Mr. Strain

Fed Enabled a Record Expansion. Trump Is Taking Credit.","Our 2020 Election Guide","Joe Biden","Donald Trump"],"story":"WASHINGTON — President Trump is using the prepandemic economy to make a case for his re-election, highlighting time and again that unemployment rates fell to record low levels for Black and Hispanic workers in 2019, and that wages were climbing steadily under his watch.He is also seeking to convince voters that he is rapidly returning America to that prosperous place following waves of pandemic-wrought job loss — fostering what he labeled a “Super V” rebound on Sunday — and that Joseph R. Biden Jr. would “destroy” the economy if he wins in November.But Mr. Trump’s story line about his economic track record, particularly what he showcased during his Republican National Convention speech last month, leaves out a crucial detail. Lucky timing and a patient Federal Reserve was pivotal in driving the strong labor market of the late 2010s, economists said. The Trump administration’s tax cuts and higher government spending temporarily nudged the economy, but the trade wars cooled it off, so the administration’s track record was mixed.That complicated reality is unlikely to stop Mr. Trump from laying claim to the successes of the 2018 and 2019 job market. But voters who want to understand what drove such strong hiring and growth might be better off looking at the actions of the Fed and its chair, Jerome H. Powell, whom Mr. Trump nominated in late 2017 and then spent more than a year attacking on Twitter and in speeches.By retaining his predecessor’s patient approach to rate increases — and then stopping them altogether as inflation, which the central bank tries to keep under control, hovered at low levels — Mr. Powell’s Fed helped to keep the longest economic expansion in United States history chugging along. The stretch of unbroken growth pushed unemployment to its lowest level in 50 years, prompting companies to cast a wider net for employees, pulling long-sidelined workers back into jobs.“Both monetary and fiscal policy were stimulative, and it did lead to a strong labor market,” said Stephanie Aaronson, a former Fed researcher who is now at the Brookings Institution. Very low inflation “has given policymakers the latitude to try new things.”That matters as more than a talking point: It could fundamentally shape the post-pandemic economy. The Fed has signaled that it intends to leave rates low to push unemployment down again, which could help return the labor market to strong levels. But the challenges posed by business closures and job reshuffling mean that elected officials, who have taxing and spending powers that the Fed lacks, may prove crucial to the speed and scope of the rebound.“The single most important thing we can do here is to support a strong labor market,” Mr. Powell said in late August remarks. “That is more of an all-governmental society project,” and “to wait to the eighth and ninth year of the cycle to get those results — we can do better than that with other policies.”To be sure, it is easy to overstate how strong conditions were before the pandemic struck.About 83 percent of adults in their prime working years were in the labor force at the start of 2020, which was a marked improvement but still down from an 84.6 percent high in the late 1990s. Inequality prevailed. Wage growth had picked up from the expansion’s early years, but it remained shy of historical records.But there is no doubt that the prepandemic job market was robust. Unemployment had declined to 3.5 percent, its lowest level in half a century. Prime-age workers who had dropped out of the labor market were surprising economists by applying for jobs. Unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers hit record lows, and pay was picking up for those who earned the least.Now, the pandemic recession has thrown millions out of work, hitting disadvantaged groups especially hard. Black unemployment stood at 13 percent in August, for instance, compared to 7.3 percent for white workers.ImagePresident Trump is trying to take credit for the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years without acknowledging the role of the Fed.Credit...Stefani Reynolds for The New York TimesMr. Trump is already taking a victory lap as the job market begins to heal, calling the rebound “the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history” during a Sunday news conference. But about half of the people who have lost jobs since February remain unemployed. Economists have warned that the return to full strength could become a grinding process, and Mr. Powell has said that some workers may struggle to return to jobs.Understanding the policy mix that helped make the labor market so strong in 2019 will be critical to putting the United States back on track for another robust period of growth.Some of the policies pushed through by Mr. Trump and lawmakers did help to bolster economic growth, which can drive hiring, economists said. The government was spending more freely, and the administration’s signature tax cuts, passed in late 2017, seem to have delivered a fleeting jolt to the economy.Economists at the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model say that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act helped growth to jump to about 3 percent for 2018, but the effect faded as growth returned to 2.2 percent in 2019.“We don’t project any material impact on growth from T.C.J.A. in 2019 or going forward,” said Alexander Arnon, a senior analyst at the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a research center that analyzes and predicts the effects of tax and other policy changes on the federal budget.Data make it clear that the administration’s policies were not the whole story.A chart of employment gains over the expansion show that they continued with remarkable consistency, month over month and year after year, starting from around 2010. The jobless rate slowly and steadily dropped. And people gradually trickled back from the labor market’s sidelines.Much of the improvement seems to have been driven by a long, steady economic expansion, creating a self-sustaining cycle in which workers got hired, spent more and fueled demand that created more jobs.Fed policy helped to enable the progress. Starting under Mr. Powell’s predecessor Janet L. Yellen, the central bank chose to lift interest rates at a historically slow pace, treading carefully to avoid crashing the expansion while also trying to avoid runaway inflation.Mr. Powell, who assumed the Fed chair in February 2018, raised rates four times during his first year — still a much slower pace than in prior business cycles — before pausing in early 2019 as markets gyrated. Under his watch, the central bank allowed the unemployment rate to fall to recent lows without trying to offset that change, and even lowered interest rates in the second half of 2019 to help sustain the expansion amid Mr. Trump’s trade war, which included steep tariffs on Chinese goods.Mr. Trump himself was publicly pushing for rate cuts, viewing that as a way to make the economy take off like a “rocket.” He regularly criticized Mr. Powell for the 2018 rate increases and then the slow pace of 2019 rate cuts. The president implied that Mr. Powell was an “enemy” and called the Fed chair and his colleagues “boneheads” for not pursuing easier monetary policy sooner.But the Fed sets rates independently of the White House and consistently ignored his advice. When it did move, it neither did so at the speed the president sought, nor by using the emergency monetary tools that he wanted.The good news for the post-crisis recovery and rebound is that the Fed is likely to again let unemployment fall sharply.In an update to its long-run framework in late August, the Fed officially signaled that it will no longer raise interest rates because of a low unemployment rate alone, effectively codifying the practice adopted last year. The bad news is that the central bank is low on ammunition to prod the economy. It was able to cut interest rates by only 1.5 percentage points when the pandemic started, compared to cuts that totaled about 5 percent during the prior two recessions. Relying too much on low rates could make for another very gradual recovery — one like the last long expansion, which took nearly a decade to really pull workers in from the sidelines. “We really need it to be broader than just the Fed,” Mr. Powell said of post-pandemic labor market policies, speaking at the Kansas City Fed’s conference in late August.Mr. Trump and his allies are correct in arguing that leadership from the White House could matter enormously. Government taxing and spending will be paramount to the strength of the coming business cycle.“President Trump and a President Biden would pursue different fiscal policy paths,” said Michael Strain, who studies economic policy at the American Enterprise Institute. “There might also be differences in how they pursue the public health situation.”Most economists argue that more government spending will be important to keeping America on a path toward full recovery. There is less agreement over shutdown versus reopening: Some stress the primacy of controlling the virus, while others argue that the costs to business and jobs are too steep.“There are a lot of unknowns,” Mr. Strain

Fed Enabled a Record Expansion. Trump Is Taking Credit.","Our 2020 Election Guide","Joe Biden","Donald Trump"],"story":"WASHINGTON — President Trump is using the prepandemic economy to make a case for his re-election, highlighting time and again that unemployment rates fell to record low levels for Black and Hispanic workers in 2019, and that wages were climbing steadily under his watch.He is also seeking to convince voters that he is rapidly returning America to that prosperous place following waves of pandemic-wrought job loss — fostering what he labeled a “Super V” rebound on Sunday — and that Joseph R. Biden Jr. would “destroy” the economy if he wins in November.But Mr. Trump’s story line about his economic track record, particularly what he showcased during his Republican National Convention speech last month, leaves out a crucial detail. Lucky timing and a patient Federal Reserve was pivotal in driving the strong labor market of the late 2010s, economists said. The Trump administration’s tax cuts and higher government spending temporarily nudged the economy, but the trade wars cooled it off, so the administration’s track record was mixed.That complicated reality is unlikely to stop Mr. Trump from laying claim to the successes of the 2018 and 2019 job market. But voters who want to understand what drove such strong hiring and growth might be better off looking at the actions of the Fed and its chair, Jerome H. Powell, whom Mr. Trump nominated in late 2017 and then spent more than a year attacking on Twitter and in speeches.By retaining his predecessor’s patient approach to rate increases — and then stopping them altogether as inflation, which the central bank tries to keep under control, hovered at low levels — Mr. Powell’s Fed helped to keep the longest economic expansion in United States history chugging along. The stretch of unbroken growth pushed unemployment to its lowest level in 50 years, prompting companies to cast a wider net for employees, pulling long-sidelined workers back into jobs.“Both monetary and fiscal policy were stimulative, and it did lead to a strong labor market,” said Stephanie Aaronson, a former Fed researcher who is now at the Brookings Institution. Very low inflation “has given policymakers the latitude to try new things.”That matters as more than a talking point: It could fundamentally shape the post-pandemic economy. The Fed has signaled that it intends to leave rates low to push unemployment down again, which could help return the labor market to strong levels. But the challenges posed by business closures and job reshuffling mean that elected officials, who have taxing and spending powers that the Fed lacks, may prove crucial to the speed and scope of the rebound.“The single most important thing we can do here is to support a strong labor market,” Mr. Powell said in late August remarks. “That is more of an all-governmental society project,” and “to wait to the eighth and ninth year of the cycle to get those results — we can do better than that with other policies.”To be sure, it is easy to overstate how strong conditions were before the pandemic struck.About 83 percent of adults in their prime working years were in the labor force at the start of 2020, which was a marked improvement but still down from an 84.6 percent high in the late 1990s. Inequality prevailed. Wage growth had picked up from the expansion’s early years, but it remained shy of historical records.But there is no doubt that the prepandemic job market was robust. Unemployment had declined to 3.5 percent, its lowest level in half a century. Prime-age workers who had dropped out of the labor market were surprising economists by applying for jobs. Unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers hit record lows, and pay was picking up for those who earned the least.Now, the pandemic recession has thrown millions out of work, hitting disadvantaged groups especially hard. Black unemployment stood at 13 percent in August, for instance, compared to 7.3 percent for white workers.ImagePresident Trump is trying to take credit for the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years without acknowledging the role of the Fed.Credit...Stefani Reynolds for The New York TimesMr. Trump is already taking a victory lap as the job market begins to heal, calling the rebound “the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history” during a Sunday news conference. But about half of the people who have lost jobs since February remain unemployed. Economists have warned that the return to full strength could become a grinding process, and Mr. Powell has said that some workers may struggle to return to jobs.Understanding the policy mix that helped make the labor market so strong in 2019 will be critical to putting the United States back on track for another robust period of growth.Some of the policies pushed through by Mr. Trump and lawmakers did help to bolster economic growth, which can drive hiring, economists said. The government was spending more freely, and the administration’s signature tax cuts, passed in late 2017, seem to have delivered a fleeting jolt to the economy.Economists at the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model say that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act helped growth to jump to about 3 percent for 2018, but the effect faded as growth returned to 2.2 percent in 2019.“We don’t project any material impact on growth from T.C.J.A. in 2019 or going forward,” said Alexander Arnon, a senior analyst at the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a research center that analyzes and predicts the effects of tax and other policy changes on the federal budget.Data make it clear that the administration’s policies were not the whole story.A chart of employment gains over the expansion show that they continued with remarkable consistency, month over month and year after year, starting from around 2010. The jobless rate slowly and steadily dropped. And people gradually trickled back from the labor market’s sidelines.Much of the improvement seems to have been driven by a long, steady economic expansion, creating a self-sustaining cycle in which workers got hired, spent more and fueled demand that created more jobs.Fed policy helped to enable the progress. Starting under Mr. Powell’s predecessor Janet L. Yellen, the central bank chose to lift interest rates at a historically slow pace, treading carefully to avoid crashing the expansion while also trying to avoid runaway inflation.Mr. Powell, who assumed the Fed chair in February 2018, raised rates four times during his first year — still a much slower pace than in prior business cycles — before pausing in early 2019 as markets gyrated. Under his watch, the central bank allowed the unemployment rate to fall to recent lows without trying to offset that change, and even lowered interest rates in the second half of 2019 to help sustain the expansion amid Mr. Trump’s trade war, which included steep tariffs on Chinese goods.Mr. Trump himself was publicly pushing for rate cuts, viewing that as a way to make the economy take off like a “rocket.” He regularly criticized Mr. Powell for the 2018 rate increases and then the slow pace of 2019 rate cuts. The president implied that Mr. Powell was an “enemy” and called the Fed chair and his colleagues “boneheads” for not pursuing easier monetary policy sooner.But the Fed sets rates independently of the White House and consistently ignored his advice. When it did move, it neither did so at the speed the president sought, nor by using the emergency monetary tools that he wanted.The good news for the post-crisis recovery and rebound is that the Fed is likely to again let unemployment fall sharply.In an update to its long-run framework in late August, the Fed officially signaled that it will no longer raise interest rates because of a low unemployment rate alone, effectively codifying the practice adopted last year. The bad news is that the central bank is low on ammunition to prod the economy. It was able to cut interest rates by only 1.5 percentage points when the pandemic started, compared to cuts that totaled about 5 percent during the prior two recessions. Relying too much on low rates could make for another very gradual recovery — one like the last long expansion, which took nearly a decade to really pull workers in from the sidelines. “We really need it to be broader than just the Fed,” Mr. Powell said of post-pandemic labor market policies, speaking at the Kansas City Fed’s conference in late August.Mr. Trump and his allies are correct in arguing that leadership from the White House could matter enormously. Government taxing and spending will be paramount to the strength of the coming business cycle.“President Trump and a President Biden would pursue different fiscal policy paths,” said Michael Strain, who studies economic policy at the American Enterprise Institute. “There might also be differences in how they pursue the public health situation.”Most economists argue that more government spending will be important to keeping America on a path toward full recovery. There is less agreement over shutdown versus reopening: Some stress the primacy of controlling the virus, while others argue that the costs to business and jobs are too steep.“There are a lot of unknowns,” Mr. Strain said."},{"address":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/business/building-signs-cities-iconic-signage.html","image":["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/08/autossell/08signs-video-01-thm/08signs-video-01-thm-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/08/business/08signs-vegas-01/merlin_176164572_aaa1e133-8ad7-4fe7-ae61-b6f9dad1f778-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/08/business/08signs-nasdaq-video-thm/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-8-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg"],"title":"Signs That Define a Building, and Sometimes a City","story":"The sign business began with painters wielding brushes and daubing letters on storefront windows and over building entrances. It has evolved into a $37.5 billion industry with companies capable of erecting signs that incorporate live news streams, interactive abilities and artificial intelligence.But the goal has always remained the same: Combine words and imagery to conjure an identity for a building and market it as a piece of real estate.Sign making evolved in the 19th and early 20th centuries with gaslight and then incandescent light bulbs used in addition to hand lettering, But business took off with the advent of neon and helped set cities like Las Vegas and New York ablaze with the giant, gaudy signs known as “spectaculars.”ImageThe illuminated signs of casinos and hotels along Fremont Street in Las Vegas are called “spectaculars.”Credit...Loomis Dean/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty ImagesAs technology continued to advance, signs incorporated plastics, screen-printed PVC vinyl and energy-saving LEDs. Today’s enormous digital billboards, which can be programmed to cycle through an array of messages, can animate entire facades.Regulations have also had an effect on the size and positioning of signs. In many places, building codes prohibit types popular in the past, such as rooftop and projecting signs including so-called blades, which stick out perpendicular to a building.Some signs have become so iconic, they are permanent parts of the landscape — and sometimes stand in for the cities in which they are found.The boldness of Miami BeachImageThe Art Deco hotels  along Ocean Drive in Miami Beach, Fla., are illuminated by glowing neon signs.Credit...Getty ImagesNothing captures the vibe of this Florida city like the pastel-colored Art Deco hotels and glowing neon signs along Ocean Drive on Miami Beach — all part of a historic district.

The 40-foot cowboy, erected in 1951 for the Pioneer Club casino, grabbed attention by waving an arm and shouting, “Howdy Podner!” He was impressive enough, but Yesco soon made him a cousin, Wendover Will, who was 23 feet taller and moved both arms outside a casino in Wendover, Nev.ImageVegas Vic beckoning tourists to the Pioneer Club casino in Las Vegas in 1955.Credit...Loomis Dean/The LIFE Picture Collection, via Getty ImagesImageVegas Vickie was removed in 2017 to make way for a new casino, but she has now moved indoors.Credit...Getty ImagesAlthough the Pioneer Club went out of business in 1995, Vegas Vic stood his ground and remains a local landmark.The extravaganza that became known as Vegas Vickie, created by Ad Art, was erected in 1980 for the Glitter Gulch casino, across the street from Vegas Vic.

The longer the history, the better.” The potential to cut costs was another.For years, Mr. Salter led a division of Hilco, a financial firm, as it snapped up the intellectual property of bankrupt retailers like Sharper Image. While the retailer’s stores closed, Hilco was involved with deals that put Sharper Image’s name on products like garment steamers that were cheaper than wares at the original retailer and then sold in chains like Bed Bath & Beyond.At Authentic Brands, Mr. Salter pulled off an early coup by acquiring the exclusive rights tied to Marilyn Monroe, whose likeness drew the interest of everyone from Dolce & Gabbana to Walmart.

He compared critics of the venture to those who told Amazon to remain in the book business.Still, rent is no small concern. In filings, Forever 21, a top tenant at Brookfield and Simon malls in the year before its bankruptcy, said the aggregate occupancy cost for its stores was $450 million annually. Lucky listed $66 million in rent and occupancy costs last year. Brooks Brothers said its 187 store leases and other corporate property leases cost about $86 million a year. On top of that, there are co-tenancy agreements, which can allow other tenants to break leases or demand rent reductions based on vacancy rates or the exit of certain retailers.“I do believe that the strategy by Simon and Brookfield is to protect their co-tenancy in a lot of cases, but I think it’s a Band-Aid,” said Jackie Levy, chief business officer of Caruso, the real estate firm that owns California open-air shopping centers like the Grove. “It might solve the immediate issue of keeping some of their smaller retailers or shops in the malls, but long-term, those leases are going to expire at some point and there’s going to be a flight to quality.”For his part, Mr. Salter sees opportunities to meld the brands that go beyond reducing corporate staff and sharing e-commerce capabilities.

The predominantly Muslim, Turkic-speaking ethnic minority have lived for years under increasingly expansive surveillance and repression in the region.The entities mentioned in the movie’s credits included the police bureau in Turpan, an ancient Silk Road city in eastern Xinjiang that has a large Uighur population. Last October, the Trump administration placed that bureau and other police organizations in Xinjiang on a blacklist that forbids U.S. companies to sell or supply products to them. It was not immediately clear on Tuesday whether U.S. officials would scrutinize Disney’s work with government agencies in Xinjiang.American politicians began firing off fiery missives against Disney. Representative Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin, wrote on Twitter that “while the CCP is committing crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, @Disney thanked four of the propaganda departments that are lying to the world about these crimes. It also thanked the Turpan Public Security Bureau, which is on the entity list for its role in these atrocities.”Politicians from both parties are strongly criticizing China over a range of issues in the run-up to the November elections.The film was already coming under fire months ago, facing calls for a boycott by supporters of the Hong Kong antigovernment protests after the movie’s star, Liu Yifei, said she backed the city’s police, who have been criticized for their use of force against pro-democracy demonstrators.Last month, as Disney ramped up promotion for the new film, supporters of the Hong Kong protests anointed Agnes Chow, a prominent democracy activist who was recently arrested under the territory’s new national security law, as their own, “real” Mulan.The criticism of the movie this week also points to broader concerns about China’s aggressive efforts to assimilate minorities, leading to rapid cultural erosion.Such fears drove protests last week that erupted in China’s northern Inner Mongolia region over a new education policy that would reduce the teaching of the Mongolian language in local schools in favor of Chinese, the language used by the dominant Han ethnic majority.Rayhan Asat, an ethnic Uighur lawyer in Washington whose younger brother, Ekpar Asat, has been imprisoned in Xinjiang, said in an interview that Disney giving credit to Xinjiang government agencies “runs counter to the ideals of those in the artistic, business and entertainment communities.”“Devastatingly, Disney’s support amounts to collaboration and enables repression,” she added. “Those who claim to champion freedom in the world cannot afford to ignore such complicity.”The details of Disney’s partnership with the authorities in Xinjiang are unclear. The company did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Tuesday morning. Calls to the regional and local propaganda departments in Xinjiang and Turpan on Tuesday also went unanswered.“Mulan” is scheduled to be released in theaters in China on Friday. But the timing of the preproduction and the filming suggests that the cast and crew may have been in Xinjiang after the government expanded its crackdown in the region in 2017.Production for the movie, which is about a Chinese folk heroine who disguises herself as a man to stand in for her ailing father in the army, reportedly began in 2018, with filming taking place mostly in China and New Zealand.The Chinese Communist Party has rejected international criticism of the internment camps in Xinjiang and has described them as job-training centers that are necessary to fight Islamic extremism. But leaked documents and testimonies by former detainees have described a ruthless and coercive environment in which physical and verbal abuse, as well as grinding indoctrination sessions, is widespread.Human rights activists and legal scholars have called the crackdown in Xinjiang the worst collective human rights abuse in China in decades.Grant Major, the film’s production designer, recently told Architectural Digest that the production team spent months in and around Xinjiang to do research before filming. In September 2017, Niki Caro, the film’s director, posted a photo of a vast desert landscape on her Instagram with the location marked as “Asia/Urumqi.” Urumqi is the capital of Xinjiang.The area surrounding Turpan, in addition to being known for its rugged landscapes, is also the site of a number of detention camps. That includes the earliest documented case of what China has called “transformation through education” targeting Muslims, from August 2013, said Adrian Zenz, a researcher at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington who has studied Chinese policies toward the Uighurs.In 2016, Zhu Hailun, a former deputy party secretary in Xinjiang, inspected Turpan’s “centralized re-education de-extremification” work, which Mr. Zenz said was an indication that “the region was an early leading example of such work.” Mr. Zhu was one of a group of Chinese officials sanctioned by the Trump administration in July for human rights abuses in Xinjiang.“This film was undertaken with the assistance of the Chinese police while at the same time these police were committing crimes against the Uighur people in Turpan,” said Tahir Imin, a Uighur activist based in Washington. “Every big company in America needs to think about whether their business is helping the Chinese government oppress the Uighur people.”Disney, which has long eyed China’s booming box office and growing middle class, has a history of running into political sensitivities in China. In 1996, the company was shut out of China’s film market after it angered officials with its backing of “Kundun,” Martin Scorsese’s 1997 film that is seen to be sympathetic to the Dalai Lama. In 2016, C. Robert Cargill, a screenwriter on “Doctor Strange,” said filmmakers had decided to scrub a central character of his Tibetan origins out of fear of treading on the Chinese government’s position on Tibet and its continuing efforts to control the region.ImageProtesting ‘Mulan’ in July outside Disney's office in Seoul, South Korea, in solidarity with Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests.Credit...Ed Jones/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe release of Disney’s original “Mulan” animated film from 1998 was delayed for a year as a result of Beijing punishing the company over “Kundun.” It was not until Disney bought the foreign distribution rights to two Chinese feature films, hired a Chinese performance troupe to participate in the European release of “Mulan” and floated the idea of opening a theme park in the country that Chinese officials finally approved the release of the film in February 1999. Later that year, Disney announced plans to build a park in Hong Kong.The animated version of “Mulan” prompted criticism at the time from Mike Pence, a staunch conservative who is Mr. Trump’s vice-president. Then a radio talk show host in Indiana, he wrote an op-ed on his program’s website that denounced the depiction of a capable woman warrior, saying it was Disney’s attempt to influence the debate over the role of women in the U.S. military.“I suspect that some mischievous liberal at Disney assumes that Mulan’s story will cause a quiet change in the next generation’s attitude about women in combat and they just might be right,” he wrote in the piece, which had the headline, “Women in the Mulan Military.”Last year, Mr. Pence criticized American companies for trying to silence speech in order to maintain access to the Chinese market. He accused Nike of checking its “conscience at the door” and owners and players in the N.B.A. of “siding with the Chinese Communist Party” by suppressing support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.In July, an ESPN investigation described reports of abuse of young players at the National Basketball Association’s player-development training camps in China, including in Xinjiang. After the investigation was published, the N.B.A. acknowledged for the first time it had closed its Xinjiang academy, but declined to say whether human rights had been a factor.On Monday, calls to boycott “Mulan” began growing on social media. Among the critics was Joshua Wong, a prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, who accused Disney of bowing to pressure from Beijing. Supporters in Thailand and Taiwan had also urged a boycott of the movie, citing concerns about China’s growing influence in the region. Amy Qin reported from Taipei, and Edward Wong from Washington.

So Is the Office. These People Want to Save Both","story":"In the beginning there was Covid-19, and the tribe of the white collars rent their garments, for their workdays were a formless void, and all their rituals were gone. New routines came to replace the old, but the routines were scattered, and there was chaos around how best to exit a Zoom, onboard an intern, end a workweek.The adrift may yet find purpose, for a new corporate clergy has arisen to formalize the remote work life. They go by different names: ritual consultants, sacred designers, soul-centered advertisers. They have degrees from divinity schools. Their business is borrowing from religious tradition to bring spiritual richness to corporate America.In simpler times, divinity schools sent their graduates out to lead congregations or conduct academic research. Now there is a more office-bound calling: the spiritual consultant. Those who have chosen this path have founded agencies — some for-profit, some not — with similar-sounding names: Sacred Design Lab, Ritual Design Lab, Ritualist. They blend the obscure language of the sacred with the also obscure language of management consulting to provide clients with a range of spiritually inflected services, from architecture to employee training to ritual design.Their larger goal is to soften cruel capitalism, making space for the soul, and to encourage employees to ask if what they are doing is good in a higher sense. Having watched social justice get readily absorbed into corporate culture, they want to see if more American businesses are ready for faith.“We’ve seen brands enter the political space,” said Casper ter Kuile, a co-founder of Sacred Design Lab. Citing a Vice report, he added: “The next white space in advertising and brands is spirituality.”ImageCasper ter Kuile is a Ministry Innovation Fellow at Harvard Divinity School and a co-founder of Sacred Design Lab.Credit...September Dawn Bottoms/The New York TimesBefore the pandemic, these agencies got their footing helping companies with design — refining their products, physical spaces and branding. They also consulted on strategy, workflow and staff management. With digital workers stuck at home since March, a new opportunity has emerged. Employers are finding their workers atomized and agitated, and are looking for guidance to bring them back together. Now the sacred consultants are helping to usher in new rituals for shapeless workdays, and trying to give employees routines that are imbued with meaning.Ezra Bookman founded Ritualist, which describes itself as “a boutique consultancy transforming companies and communities through the art of ritual,” last year in Brooklyn. He has come up with rituals for small firms for events like the successful completion of a project — or, if one fails, a funeral.“How do we help people process the grief when a project fails and help them to move on from it?” Mr. Bookman said.Messages on the start-up’s Instagram feed read like a kind of menu for companies who want to buy operational rites a la carte: “A ritual for purchasing your domain name (aka your little plot of virtual land up in the clouds).” “A ritual for when you get the email from LegalZoom that you’ve been officially registered as an LLC.”‘People would cite SoulCycle’The sacred consultant trend might be led by the co-founders of Sacred Design Lab — Mr. ter Kuile, Angie Thurston and Sue Phillips. They met at Harvard Divinity School, where they remain affiliated as inaugural Ministry Innovation Fellows, and founded their organization as a nonprofit in 2019.Their backgrounds vary. Mr. ter Kuile, who lives in Brooklyn and co-hosts a popular Harry Potter podcast, wrote a book on how to “transform common, everyday practices — yoga, reading, walking the dog — into sacred rituals.” Ms. Thurston, who lives in Alexandria, Va., had worked at finding spiritual connection between people from different faiths. Ms. Phillips, of Tacoma, Wash., is an ordained minister in the Unitarian Universalist tradition.What they have in common is an agreement that traditional religious institutions are not working and that corporate culture is largely soulless.At Harvard Divinity School, scholars have been studying the trend away from organized religion for decades. Their consensus is that while attendance at formal services is at a historic low, people are still looking for meaning and spirituality. Dudley Rose, the associate dean for ministry studies, noted that secular spaces were doing a surprisingly good job of fulfilling this desire.“People were meeting what they identified as spiritual needs, but doing them in organizations that had no apparent spiritual connection,” Mr. Rose said in an interview. “Like SoulCycle. People would cite SoulCycle.”Mr. ter Kuile, Ms. Thurston and Ms. Phillips saw it like this: If part of religious work is finding people in need wherever they are, then spiritual innovators should go toward the workplace.“Regardless of what you and I might think about it, the fact is that people are showing up in the workplace with these big deficits in themselves when it comes to belonging and connection to the beyond,” Ms. Thurston said.ImageMaceo Paisley, left, an experience designer, presents a prototype for a grief ritual at an event hosted by Sacred Design Lab.Credit...Suzanne TennantThe Sacred Design Lab trio use the language of faith and church to talk about their efforts. They talk about organized religion as a technology for delivering meaning.“The question we ask is: ‘How do you translate the ancient traditions that have given people access to meaning-making practices, but in a context that is not centered around the congregation?’” Mr. ter Kuile said.The nonprofit says it has been thinking of sacred designs for companies like Pinterest, IDEO and the Obama Foundation.Ms. Phillips doesn’t see corporations replacing organized religion — but, she said, she does see an opportunity for companies to bring people some of the meaning that they used to derive from churches, temples, mosques and the like.She talks about her work like a pastor would. “We spend a lot of time doing witness and accompaniment of our clients,” she said. “We listen to their stories. We want to understand their lives. We want to understand their passion and their longing.”Evan Sharp, the co-founder of Pinterest, hired Sacred Design Lab to categorize all major religious practices and think of ways to apply them to the office. They made him a spreadsheet.“We pulled together hundreds of practices from all these different religions and cultural practices and put them in a spreadsheet and just tried to categorize them by emotional state: which ones are relevant when you’re happy, which are relevant when you’re angry, and a couple other pieces of metadata,” Mr. Sharp said.When he had the data, he said, he took a few days and read it all. “This sounds embarrassingly basic,” he said, “but it really reframed parts of religion for me.”It made him realize how many useful tools existed inside something as old-fashioned as his childhood church. “Some of the rituals I grew up with in Protestantism really have emotional utility,” he said. And Mr. Sharp saw that it was good.‘It’s still an office’There are perils, of course, with bringing elements of spirituality into the office.The mixture of corporate and religious language can be odd. For example, here is how Mr. ter Kuile described his work for a tech company he declined to name: “We researched and authored a concept paper on The Soul of Work to stimulate bold ideas about how soul-centeredness will continue to grow as a core element of the future of work.”Another challenge is that many workers are already devout on their own terms, on their own time, and are not at all hungry for soul-based activities between 9 and 5.ImageAngie Thurston, a co-founder of Sacred Design Lab. “People are showing up in the workplace with these big deficits in themselves when it comes to belonging and connection to the beyond,” she said.Credit...Rosie Brock for The New York TimesAnd: It’s hard to exhort workers to give their professional activities transcendental meaning when, at the same time, those workers can be terminated. “It can be done badly, and when done badly it can cause harm,” Ms. Thurston said. “For example, ‘How can we be in deep community if I can fire you?’”Ms. Thurston cited a host of possible problems to grapple with: creating a workplace religion, mixing management and soulfulness, getting paid for spirituality. “Even if this is all done well and a workplace becomes really soul-centered, it’s still an office,” Ms. Thurston said. “These are the challenges.”Companies hiring ritual consultants may think they are bringing workers a small perk. But those behind the movement are hoping for a bigger revolution.Workers have achieved measured success recently in pressuring employers to address systemic racism — some companies are making Juneteenth a paid holiday, for example, and investing in Black- and minority-owned ventures — and the sacred design consultants are wondering if employees might also begin to demand spiritual goodness.This possibility is what drew Bob Boisture to the divinity consultants. He is the chief executive of the Fetzer Institute, a Michigan nonprofit foundation that says its mission is “helping build the spiritual foundation for a loving world,” and which helps fund Sacred Design Lab. Mr. Boisture said he hopes the group’s work could eventually allow corporate employees to articulate complaints and stop projects or practices that they see as lucrative but immoral.“We today pay attention to a business’s profits; the deeper question is whether the business ennobles or debases human existence,” Mr. Boisture said. “We encourage employees to bring moral concerns into the business conversation.”And so the consultants find rituals and religious language and pull them out from their religious context, the better — in theory — to keep workers from feeling alienated. But rituals without religion can go haywire.Tara Isabella Burton, the author of “Strange Rites: New Religions for a Godless World,” calls it the bespoke-ification of religion, or the unbundling of rituals — a reference to how cable TV packages split apart after the advent of streaming services. In the unbundled world, people pick what they want from different faiths and incorporate it into their lives — a little Buddhism here, a little kabbalah there. It is consumer-driven religiosity.“The idea is that what we want, what feels good to us, what we desire, that all of this is constitutive of who we are, rather than community,” Ms. Burton said. “We risk seeing spirituality as something we can consume, something for us, something for our brand.”Deepening one’s Zoom practiceIn a workday spent at home, standing in front of a computer while meetings come and go, projects are received and filed, there is no differentiation. Every activity is, physically, the same.I’m hungry for ritual. Every day, I get dressed, put on shoes, make coffee, pour it in a mug and tell my two housemates that I’m heading to work and will see ’em later. Then I walk in a few circles and settle in at a desk in the corner of our living room, just a couple feet away. This is my deranged coronavirus commute and it’s how I help my bleary mind realize that the workday has begun.If my boss said we would be instituting a one-minute group breathing exercise in the evenings to mark the closing of our laptops, or beginning each meeting by all smelling a clove together, would I like it? I would.It’s easy to blur the line between routine and ritual. Which category is it, for example, to have a habit of taking a shower and staring at the ceiling for five minutes after accomplishing my day’s main task? Does the label matter, if the action feels essential?To be technical, though, Kathleen McTigue, a Unitarian Universalist minister and a mentor to Mr. ter Kuile, offers a definition. She describes rituals as elevated routines, with set intention, attention and repetition.Kursat Ozenc has been in the corporate ritual game for a while, as a product designer at the software giant SAP. He wrote “Rituals for Work” last year, and in January will publish a follow-up of sorts, “Rituals for Virtual Meetings.” I called him for recommendations on how to deepen my Zoom practice.Mr. Ozenc advised incorporating thoughtful interruptions. He suggested beginning conference calls with a moment of silence. He recently heard about a smelling ritual, where everyone in a meeting retrieves a common kitchen spice, maybe cinnamon, and smells it at the same time to get a co-sensory experience. He is hoping to incorporate this into his guidance, as a way to bind people together.“In the physical world, we experience the same senses together, the same temperature, the same smell of food heating up,” Mr. Ozenc said.ImageSue Phillips, a co-founder of the Sacred Design Lab, talks about her work like a pastor would. “We spend a lot of time doing witness and accompaniment of our clients,” she said.Credit...Ruth Fremson/The New York TimesMs. Phillips, the minister, had a few other ideas. She suggested using a repetitive meeting structure, which can be calming for participants. This might take the form of starting each team meeting with the same words, a sort of corporate incantation.Others suggested workers each light a candle at the start of a meeting, or pick up a common object that everyone is likely to have in their homes.Glenn Fajardo, a teaching fellow and lecturer at Stanford’s design school who is researching rituals for virtual work, said to think of the workday like a movie, with structure and cuts and suspense, based on predictable arcs.“Say to the group, ‘During this part of the conversation, everybody’s going to turn off our video,’” Mr. Fajardo said. “Or, ‘While we’re doing this activity, I want you to look at your notebook.’”“Part of what you’re doing with ritual is creating these chunks people can remember, creating this element of something familiar and something new.”Jeffrey D. Lee, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Chicago, helped organize a three day retreat last year with Mr. ter Kuile and others. The purpose of the retreat was to allow spiritual entrepreneurs to brainstorm with traditional religious leaders. He described one participant as “an experience designer creating potent rituals for executives.”Bishop Lee said he was happy to find the religious impulse at play, even if it was in places where the ultimate calling was profit. “We’re really aware of being on the shadow side of religious observance, a truly historic decline,” he said, “so there’s some good news in here for how people are hungry for ritual.”"},{"address":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/business/remote-work-spiritual-consultants.html","image":["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/30/business/28Workritual-illo/28Workritual-illo-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/30/business/00workritual3/merlin_175417833_3c3ae16f-5205-4f34-8927-1096214ab245-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"],"title":"God Is Dead.

And Mr. Sharp saw that it was good.‘It’s still an office’There are perils, of course, with bringing elements of spirituality into the office.The mixture of corporate and religious language can be odd. For example, here is how Mr. ter Kuile described his work for a tech company he declined to name: “We researched and authored a concept paper on The Soul of Work to stimulate bold ideas about how soul-centeredness will continue to grow as a core element of the future of work.”Another challenge is that many workers are already devout on their own terms, on their own time, and are not at all hungry for soul-based activities between 9 and 5.ImageAngie Thurston, a co-founder of Sacred Design Lab. “People are showing up in the workplace with these big deficits in themselves when it comes to belonging and connection to the beyond,” she said.Credit...Rosie Brock for The New York TimesAnd: It’s hard to exhort workers to give their professional activities transcendental meaning when, at the same time, those workers can be terminated. “It can be done badly, and when done badly it can cause harm,” Ms. Thurston said. “For example, ‘How can we be in deep community if I can fire you?’”Ms. Thurston cited a host of possible problems to grapple with: creating a workplace religion, mixing management and soulfulness, getting paid for spirituality. “Even if this is all done well and a workplace becomes really soul-centered, it’s still an office,” Ms. Thurston said. “These are the challenges.”Companies hiring ritual consultants may think they are bringing workers a small perk. But those behind the movement are hoping for a bigger revolution.Workers have achieved measured success recently in pressuring employers to address systemic racism — some companies are making Juneteenth a paid holiday, for example, and investing in Black- and minority-owned ventures — and the sacred design consultants are wondering if employees might also begin to demand spiritual goodness.This possibility is what drew Bob Boisture to the divinity consultants. He is the chief executive of the Fetzer Institute, a Michigan nonprofit foundation that says its mission is “helping build the spiritual foundation for a loving world,” and which helps fund Sacred Design Lab. Mr. Boisture said he hopes the group’s work could eventually allow corporate employees to articulate complaints and stop projects or practices that they see as lucrative but immoral.“We today pay attention to a business’s profits; the deeper question is whether the business ennobles or debases human existence,” Mr. Boisture said. “We encourage employees to bring moral concerns into the business conversation.”And so the consultants find rituals and religious language and pull them out from their religious context, the better — in theory — to keep workers from feeling alienated. But rituals without religion can go haywire.Tara Isabella Burton, the author of “Strange Rites: New Religions for a Godless World,” calls it the bespoke-ification of religion, or the unbundling of rituals — a reference to how cable TV packages split apart after the advent of streaming services. In the unbundled world, people pick what they want from different faiths and incorporate it into their lives — a little Buddhism here, a little kabbalah there. It is consumer-driven religiosity.“The idea is that what we want, what feels good to us, what we desire, that all of this is constitutive of who we are, rather than community,” Ms. Burton said. “We risk seeing spirituality as something we can consume, something for us, something for our brand.”Deepening one’s Zoom practiceIn a workday spent at home, standing in front of a computer while meetings come and go, projects are received and filed, there is no differentiation. Every activity is, physically, the same.I’m hungry for ritual. Every day, I get dressed, put on shoes, make coffee, pour it in a mug and tell my two housemates that I’m heading to work and will see ’em later. Then I walk in a few circles and settle in at a desk in the corner of our living room, just a couple feet away. This is my deranged coronavirus commute and it’s how I help my bleary mind realize that the workday has begun.If my boss said we would be instituting a one-minute group breathing exercise in the evenings to mark the closing of our laptops, or beginning each meeting by all smelling a clove together, would I like it? I would.It’s easy to blur the line between routine and ritual. Which category is it, for example, to have a habit of taking a shower and staring at the ceiling for five minutes after accomplishing my day’s main task? Does the label matter, if the action feels essential?To be technical, though, Kathleen McTigue, a Unitarian Universalist minister and a mentor to Mr. ter Kuile, offers a definition. She describes rituals as elevated routines, with set intention, attention and repetition.Kursat Ozenc has been in the corporate ritual game for a while, as a product designer at the software giant SAP. He wrote “Rituals for Work” last year, and in January will publish a follow-up of sorts, “Rituals for Virtual Meetings.” I called him for recommendations on how to deepen my Zoom practice.Mr. Ozenc advised incorporating thoughtful interruptions. He suggested beginning conference calls with a moment of silence. He recently heard about a smelling ritual, where everyone in a meeting retrieves a common kitchen spice, maybe cinnamon, and smells it at the same time to get a co-sensory experience. He is hoping to incorporate this into his guidance, as a way to bind people together.“In the physical world, we experience the same senses together, the same temperature, the same smell of food heating up,” Mr. Ozenc said.ImageSue Phillips, a co-founder of the Sacred Design Lab, talks about her work like a pastor would. “We spend a lot of time doing witness and accompaniment of our clients,” she said.Credit...Ruth Fremson/The New York TimesMs. Phillips, the minister, had a few other ideas. She suggested using a repetitive meeting structure, which can be calming for participants. This might take the form of starting each team meeting with the same words, a sort of corporate incantation.Others suggested workers each light a candle at the start of a meeting, or pick up a common object that everyone is likely to have in their homes.Glenn Fajardo, a teaching fellow and lecturer at Stanford’s design school who is researching rituals for virtual work, said to think of the workday like a movie, with structure and cuts and suspense, based on predictable arcs.“Say to the group, ‘During this part of the conversation, everybody’s going to turn off our video,’” Mr. Fajardo said. “Or, ‘While we’re doing this activity, I want you to look at your notebook.’”“Part of what you’re doing with ritual is creating these chunks people can remember, creating this element of something familiar and something new.”Jeffrey D. Lee, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Chicago, helped organize a three day retreat last year with Mr. ter Kuile and others. The purpose of the retreat was to allow spiritual entrepreneurs to brainstorm with traditional religious leaders. He described one participant as “an experience designer creating potent rituals for executives.”Bishop Lee said he was happy to find the religious impulse at play, even if it was in places where the ultimate calling was profit. “We’re really aware of being on the shadow side of religious observance, a truly historic decline,” he said, “so there’s some good news in here for how people are hungry for ritual.”"},{"address":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/business/economy/rent-tenants-evictions.html","image":["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/23/business/21Virus-Housing-Moshtael/21Virus-Housing-Moshtael-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/21/business/21Virus-Housing-moshtael-02/21Virus-Housing-moshtael-02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"],"title":["They’re Making the Rent. Is It Costing Their Future?","Latest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak and the Economy"],"story":"They’ve made it with government checks and family help. They’ve made it with savings and odd jobs. They’ve made it with church charity, nonprofit rescue funds, GoFundMe campaigns. One way or another, through five months of economic dislocation, the nation’s tenants have for the most part made their rent.Now the question is how much longer these patchwork maneuvers will work — and what will happen to the economy if they suddenly don’t.Almost from the moment the coronavirus upended the economy in March, there has been a persistent fear that the loss of wages and employment, concentrated among lower-income service workers, would lead to widespread evictions. According to one study, as many as 40 million people in 17 million households risk eviction by the end of the year — an astounding figure.Yet interviews with dozens of landlords across the country returned comments like “no difference,” “pleasantly surprised” and “seems like normal.” That view is reinforced by the corporate earnings reports of housing providers and a weekly survey of big landlords by the National Multifamily Housing Council, which for several months has shown little difference from rent collections a year ago.On its face, the disconnect between upbeat landlords and anxious tenants seems to expose a glitch in the data or an example of the growing economic dissonance — like the stock market’s rise to new heights despite a 10.2 percent unemployment rate. What it actually shows is that for all of the government’s problems in containing the virus, financial rescue efforts were largely effective in keeping tenants in their homes.The $2 trillion CARES Act, with its $1,200 stimulus payments and $600 a week in extended unemployment benefits, helped laid-off renters stay current, while federal, state and local eviction moratoriums guaranteed stability for those who could not. But those efforts have largely lapsed: The $600 payments ended in July, and about 20 states have eviction moratoriums, down from 43 in May.President Trump signed an executive order telling federal agencies to help avoid evictions, but the provisions were vague. Congress has been at an impasse over new aid, and a stopgap $300 weekly unemployment supplement announced by Mr. Trump has reached few workers so far and will provide only a few weeks of relief.In the meantime, mounting bills are prompting tenants to take ever more desperate measures, with potentially devastating long-term effects.Lindsey Henderson, a laid-off retail bagging assistant from Round Rock, Texas, has been paying her rent with a Chase Freedom credit card so that she and her husband can preserve cash and accrue points that help save on food and gas. Olivia Meaders, a 24-year-old woman in Beaverton, Ore., was laid off twice — once in March, and again in July — from her job as a retail manager at a men’s apparel store. To make enough money to pay rent, she began making deliveries for Postmates. Randy Ping, a 49-year-old street performer in Manchester Township, N.J., received $3,000 in donations from friends and has paid his rent through September, but he expects to miss his payment for October and move out shortly after.“I don’t want to ask people to donate again,” Mr. Ping said. “I really hate borrowing money.”For others, efforts to conserve money and avoid missing rent have caused them to retrench on investments like education. That balancing act, even if it keeps tenants in their homes for now, won’t just affect the near-term economic recovery — it could also cause damage that permanently alters the trajectories of their lives.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Latest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak and the Economy\n  \n  \n  \n    4h ago\n    The latest: Under Armour announces layoffs, and Luby’s will liquidate.\n  \n    4h ago\n    Lululemon reports a quarterly profit as consumers flock to yoga pants.\n  \n    6h ago\n    The work-from-home challenge for employees of color.\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    See more updates\n  \n  \n    More live coverage:\n    \n      Global\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Would-Be Pilot, GroundedImageNura Moshtael was finally pursuing her dream of becoming a commercial airline pilot. But with the end of $600 a week in extended unemployment benefits, “I can’t afford to chase that dream anymore,” she said.Credit...Audra Melton for The New York TimesFor as long as she can remember, Nura Moshtael has dreamed of being a pilot for a major airline. She studied aviation in college, but after giving birth to a son with Down syndrome, she spent a dozen years raising him on her own, without the time or the money to finish her training.Now 45, Ms. Moshtael decided in January that it was time to pursue becoming a commercial pilot or let her dream slip away. She started two jobs, one at a local restaurant and another at a cafe inside a Neiman Marcus. It was exhausting, yet energizing: Each successive paycheck was a down payment on hopes for a new career and a better life.Two months later, after the coronavirus struck, she was furloughed from Neiman Marcus and laid off from the restaurant. With the $600 a week in supplementary benefits, she was able to keep paying the rent and utilities for her apartment in Atlanta. But in July, just as the $600 payments ended, her lease came up for renewal.The $1,460 a month she was receiving in state unemployment benefits — her only income — would not cover her expenses, which included $1,950 in rent, a $430 car payment, plus food, utilities and her student loan. Ms. Moshtael felt she had no choice but to pack up her apartment and move in with her mother in her childhood home more than 90 miles away in Macon, Ga.“I would not have made this decision if the $600 had still been intact, but since it was still up in the air and my lease was expiring, I just had to move out,” she said. “I’m just lucky I have somewhere else to go.”Though she is relieved to not have to worry about rent, the move comes at a sacrifice. Her son, who struggles to adapt to new situations, will have to make new friends. She will miss the daily companionship of her boyfriend. But perhaps the most poignant and permanent loss for Ms. Moshtael is the prospect of being a pilot.“That’s dead in the water now,” she said. “I can’t afford to chase that dream anymore.”From a Tripled Income to the Food PantryImageJared Strickland and Karla Dennington, with their children, Gracey, 1, Serenity, 12, and Riley, 14, at his parents’ home in St. Augustine, Fla., where they live.Credit...Charlotte Kesl for The New York TimesSurveys by the Census Bureau and private apartment companies have shown tenants to be increasingly skeptical that they will be able to make the next month’s rent. So far, the worst predictions have failed to materialize.“There has been lots of noise in the media and among policymakers regarding the potential avalanche of evictions,” said Daryl J. Carter, chief executive of Avanath Capital Management, an investment firm in Irvine, Calif., with 10,000 housing units across the country. “This is simply not the case.”But a strict focus on evictions can create a misleadingly optimistic picture. The forcible removal of people from their homes is a complicated, drawn-out process that varies by state because it is subject to local regulations and courts. While there are close to four million eviction filings each year, about a million result in tenants’ being removed from their homes, a number that seems to operate independent of the economic cycle, according to Princeton University’s Eviction Lab.Even if that number never budges in the current crisis, the damage is already here. And as the effects of congressional spending fade, the pain tenants feel is likely to intensify. Many urban markets are already seeing rents fall and vacancies rise. “People that can’t pay may have already moved out of their apartment and in with their family or friends, thus no longer in the denominator of the collection rates,” said John Pawlowski, an analyst with Green Street Advisors, a real estate research firm in Newport Beach, Calif.Instead of an avalanche, the appropriate metaphor might be a receding tide that is exposing layers of financial insecurity.Even before the pandemic, about 25 percent of tenants were paying at least half their pretax income for housing. Without a paycheck or enough unemployment pay, many may move out before they actually face eviction. Those who hang on may have to cut spending on essentials like food and medicine. And for some who have longed to make the transition from tenant to homeowner, the outlook has grown more daunting.Jared Strickland, 36, and his fiancée, Karla Dennington, 34, have been living with Mr. Strickland’s parents for 16 years to save money while he worked in low-paying retail jobs and she stayed home with their three children, ages 17 months to 14 years old. In January, their life changed: Mr. Strickland found a sales job at a time-share company in St. Augustine, Fla., and his income more than tripled. Full of hope, they made plans for things that had been financially out of reach: They set a wedding date of Sept. 13 and started looking for a house to buy.When the pandemic hit, Mr. Strickland was furloughed and then laid off. His state unemployment payments ran out over a month ago, so their extended family is relying on $150 a week Mr. Strickland gets from the federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, Mr. Strickland’s parents’ Social Security payments and his 66-year-old father’s part-time job as a greeter at Walmart. To keep food on the table, they make monthly trips to their local food pantry.“The plan was to save up for six months and then move into our own place,” he said. “But then all of a sudden, this pandemic happened, I lost my job, and we’re back to square one. We can’t even afford food now. There’s no way we’ll be able to move out any time soon.”Bracing for NonpaymentImageJoseph Razavian, 34, is a landlord in Atlanta who caters to lower-income tenants.Credit...Audra Melton for The New York TimesRental housing is a highly fragmented market of 48 million units across the country, and while collections have been steady at the generally more expensive properties whose corporate owners are represented by the National Multifamily Housing Council, strain is emerging in other tiers. Even as corporate landlords report little change, smaller landlords are reporting declining collections and in many cases expect to use loans and personal savings to cover shortfalls.Partly this is because these landlords have less access to capital than large corporations, but buildings like duplexes and triplexes — the kinds of properties that many small landlords own — tend to be more affordable, so they attract lower-income tenants, who have been hit the hardest by the pandemic. A recent survey by LeaseLock, a company that sells lease insurance to replace rental deposits, showed that collections in lower-end properties had declined throughout the pandemic, with only one-quarter of tenants making full rent payment through the first 15 days of July, compared with 55 percent over the same period the first three months of the year.In the early weeks of the pandemic, Joseph Razavian was expecting a disaster that never arose. Mr. Razavian is a 34-year-old landlord who owns a duplex and triplex in the Atlanta area. Charging $1,400 for a four-bedroom apartment with no security deposit required, Mr. Razavian caters to lower-income tenants who can’t afford to pay a standard rental arrangement in which at least two months of rent are required up front.Given the spike in unemployment and the virus’s disparate impact on hourly workers, Mr. Razavian braced for nonpayments and comforted himself with the reserve fund he’d built up. Then April, May and June passed with no decline in rent collections, a phenomenon he attributed to the $600 unemployment supplement.Without it, rents have already started slipping. Several tenants haven’t paid rent. Others are making partial payments and asking for extended payment plans. “At the beginning of the pandemic, I expected what I’m seeing now,” he said.Mr. Razavian said a tenant who is two months behind on rent has agreed to work off the debt by mowing the lawn for the rest of the year. (As a consequence, Mr. Razavian got rid of his landscaping service.) Another tenant got a $50-a-month break in exchange for light management duties like collecting checks and mail.Unless Congress acts to augment unemployment pay until the job market rebounds, Mr. Razavian said, “there are going to be a lot of folks who don’t have money to pay rent.”How long can he go before he starts considering evicting people? “The next couple of months are going to be very interesting,” he said, making it clear that by “interesting” he meant dreadful.ImageA residence in East Point, a suburb of Atlanta, that is owned by Mr. Razavian.Credit...Audra Melton for The New York TimesMr. Razavian’s lower-rent properties are a national early indicator. Avail, a platform that helps small landlords manage their properties, recently surveyed about 5,000 tenants and landlords and found that 42 percent of tenants and 35 percent of landlords were pulling money from savings and emergency funds to make it through the pandemic.Katie Bakken, an unemployed medical biologist in Kansas City, Mo., is months away from anything dire. She has enough savings to pay her rent through the end of the year and is confident that she will find a job as soon as the economy recovers. Unsure when that will be or what further measures, if any, will emerge to help the jobless, she is paring her spending by cutting out takeout meals and canceling her Costco card, and accruing debt by paying only the minimum on her credit card bill.“I can go maybe five or six months paying rent,” she said. “But after that, what do I do?”"},{"address":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/business/economy/rent-tenants-evictions.html","image":["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/23/business/21Virus-Housing-Moshtael/21Virus-Housing-Moshtael-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/21/business/21Virus-Housing-moshtael-02/21Virus-Housing-moshtael-02-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"],"title":["They’re Making the Rent.

Charging $1,400 for a four-bedroom apartment with no security deposit required, Mr. Razavian caters to lower-income tenants who can’t afford to pay a standard rental arrangement in which at least two months of rent are required up front.Given the spike in unemployment and the virus’s disparate impact on hourly workers, Mr. Razavian braced for nonpayments and comforted himself with the reserve fund he’d built up. Then April, May and June passed with no decline in rent collections, a phenomenon he attributed to the $600 unemployment supplement.Without it, rents have already started slipping. Several tenants haven’t paid rent. Others are making partial payments and asking for extended payment plans. “At the beginning of the pandemic, I expected what I’m seeing now,” he said.Mr. Razavian said a tenant who is two months behind on rent has agreed to work off the debt by mowing the lawn for the rest of the year. (As a consequence, Mr. Razavian got rid of his landscaping service.) Another tenant got a $50-a-month break in exchange for light management duties like collecting checks and mail.Unless Congress acts to augment unemployment pay until the job market rebounds, Mr. Razavian said, “there are going to be a lot of folks who don’t have money to pay rent.”How long can he go before he starts considering evicting people? “The next couple of months are going to be very interesting,” he said, making it clear that by “interesting” he meant dreadful.ImageA residence in East Point, a suburb of Atlanta, that is owned by Mr. Razavian.Credit...Audra Melton for The New York TimesMr. Razavian’s lower-rent properties are a national early indicator. Avail, a platform that helps small landlords manage their properties, recently surveyed about 5,000 tenants and landlords and found that 42 percent of tenants and 35 percent of landlords were pulling money from savings and emergency funds to make it through the pandemic.Katie Bakken, an unemployed medical biologist in Kansas City, Mo., is months away from anything dire. She has enough savings to pay her rent through the end of the year and is confident that she will find a job as soon as the economy recovers. Unsure when that will be or what further measures, if any, will emerge to help the jobless, she is paring her spending by cutting out takeout meals and canceling her Costco card, and accruing debt by paying only the minimum on her credit card bill.“I can go maybe five or six months paying rent,” she said. “But after that, what do I do?”"},{"address":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/business/corporate-child-abduction.html","image":["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/16/business/13ChildAbuction-Swing/merlin_173423802_937d8b04-bc73-45d5-b3d1-e8a1e9c6cc2d-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/16/business/13ChildAbduction-school-ext/merlin_173423808_81c71905-22fd-4c28-a924-cad027589299-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"],"title":"The Three Abductions of N.: How Corporate Kidnapping Works","story":"1. $14,000 and a new passportA few days before Christmas 2013, Stuart Dempster hired a car to take him from Bangkok to the rural town of Ban Phai, in northeastern Thailand. Mr. Dempster, a 55-year-old track and field coach from Australia, was accompanied by a tall, burly security contractor. The two men were preparing to abduct Mr. Dempster’s daughter.As they sped north, winding past the mountain-rimmed Lam Takhong reservoir and Khao Yai National Park, Mr. Dempster wasn’t sure what to expect. He had not seen his 5-year-old, N., in almost a year. At home in Brisbane, he had agreed to spend several thousand dollars to hire the contractor, Brad Stilla, through a company called Child Recovery Australia, one of a handful of agencies that reunite parents with children taken by estranged partners. Mr. Stilla met Mr. Dempster at a hotel in Bangkok, after flying in from China, and boasted that he knew kung fu.ImageThe Holy Redeemer Ban Phai School, in northeastern Thailand. When an attempted abduction caused panic, Colin Chapman, who was monitoring the scene by phone, told his operative: “How much cash have you got on you? Start waving that around.”Credit...Adam Dean for The New York TimesAfter several hours, the car pulled up outside Holy Redeemer Ban Phai School, a private Catholic academy on a busy, tree-lined street in the center of town. Mr. Dempster and Mr. Stilla walked toward the entrance — a wide, airy atrium next to a basketball court. Mr. Dempster felt a nervous sensation in his stomach, the way he often did before important races. Inside the school, he asked where he could find N., and a teacher pointed toward a classroom up a flight of stairs. He wondered whether his daughter would recognize him.Eleven months earlier, Mr. Dempster’s wife, a Thai woman named Atchariya Chaloemmeeprasert, had taken N. to Ban Phai to visit relatives. It was an unhappy time in the marriage: With a 24-year age difference, they argued often and had been sleeping in separate bedrooms. During her trip to Ban Phai, Ms. Atchariya never called home. The day she was scheduled to fly back, her uncle, a Scot who ran a business in Thailand, told Mr. Dempster that she no longer wanted to speak with him. She planned to remain in Ban Phai with their daughter.“It was difficult to think straight,” Mr. Dempster recalled. “I just thought, ‘Have I done anything wrong?’ Nobody’s perfect, and there’s no hard-and-fast rule for bringing kids up or for relationships. But I had done nothing to justify that.”There is often little the local police or family courts can do when one parent takes a child overseas without the other parent’s permission. But in Australia, the United States and dozens of other countries, the parent who is left behind can seek the child’s return under a 1980 international treaty, the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Countries that adopt the pact agree to help resolve international parental abduction cases by returning children to their “habitual residence,” where local family courts can determine custody.ImageN.’s mother, Atchariya Chaloemmeeprasert, at her home in Ban Phai. “If I didn’t find her,” she said, about one thwarted abduction, “I thought that my heart would have been broken to pieces.”Credit...Adam Dean for The New York TimesIn early 2013, not long after N. vanished into Thailand, Mr. Dempster contacted the Australian attorney general’s office to seek his daughter’s return. He soon became frustrated with the process. The paperwork was complicated. His caseworker was slow to return his messages. And once the Australian government broached the issue with Thailand, local authorities claimed they could not locate Ms. Atchariya. “It’s a failed system,” Mr. Dempster said. “It fails us all the time.”As the months passed, Mr. Dempster started considering another option. He had read online about bounty hunters who retrieve abducted children — an entire industry of self-proclaimed “recovery agents” who operate in legal and ethical gray zones, snatching children off the street in foreign countries.A lawyer at the Australian attorney general’s office urged Mr. Dempster to avoid these groups, which often break the law, bribing police and smuggling children across borders. Some parents have lost tens of thousands of dollars to agents who turned out to be dishonest or inept. Even a successful “recovery” can put a child in harm’s way. “Two wrongs don’t make a right,” the lawyer told him.But Mr. Dempster was impressed by the website of Child Recovery Australia. In late 2013, he traveled along Australia’s Sunshine Coast to meet the company’s founder, a silver-haired private investigator named Colin Chapman, who got his start tracking children for an Australian television network in the 1990s. After listening to Mr. Dempster’s story, Mr. Chapman showed him images of Ban Phai on Google Earth and explained how to obtain a new passport for his daughter.He said he could arrange a recovery for around $14,000. He told Mr. Dempster to meet Mr. Stilla in Thailand.2. ‘Help me! I can’t breathe.’When Mr. Dempster peered inside the classroom at Holy Redeemer, he immediately spotted N. at a desk by the window. He picked her up and walked out as Mr. Stilla followed, talking by phone with Mr. Chapman, who was overseeing the operation from Australia. “All right,” Mr. Stilla said, in Mr. Chapman’s recollection. “This is good.”But the sight of two foreigners removing a small child caused alarm at Holy Redeemer. Taweerart Nilda had taught at the school since Ms. Atchariya and her older brothers attended decades earlier, and she followed Mr. Dempster and Mr. Stilla as they hurried out. She tried to ask what was happening, but Mr. Stilla brushed her away. “They walked in as if they had authority,” she recalled. “They did not care about anything.”ImageTaweerart Nilda, one of N.’s former teachers at Ban Phai Holy Redeemer, tried to stop a kidnapping.Credit...Adam Dean for The New York TimesOutside, it was a typical Thai winter day — about 70 degrees, with a clear blue sky. Some older students were playing soccer. Ms. Taweerart and a few other teachers followed Mr. Dempster and Mr. Stilla through the courtyard, past a statue of Jesus underneath a red-and-white awning. By the time Mr. Dempster and Mr. Stilla reached the street, a crowd was beginning to form. The driver refused to open the car door. Ms. Taweerart started pulling N. from Mr. Dempster’s arms. She recalls the girl screaming in Thai: “Help me! I can’t breathe.”Still on the phone with Mr. Chapman, Mr. Stilla made a futile attempt to use his bulky frame to fend off the teachers and explain that N. was Mr. Dempster’s daughter. “Now what do I do?” he said into his phone.“How much cash have you got on you?” Mr. Chapman responded. “Start waving that around.”The confrontation was escalating. Police officers had appeared on the scene. One reached toward Mr. Dempster, who tried to elbow him away, only for the force of the crowd to push them even closer together. A group of male teachers grappled with Mr. Dempster, trying to wrest N. from his arms.“How long can you hold onto a kid?” Mr. Dempster told me recently. “It was a tug of war, and I thought, ‘This is too much stress for her.’ So I let go.”3. The child abduction industryImageSome of N.’s favorite clothes and her backpack.Credit...Adam Dean for The New York TimesWhen people think of kidnappers, they often imagine strangers in dark vans, luring young victims with candy. But most child abduction in the United States happens within families. In 2019, the State Department reported nearly 500 new abduction cases in which parents took their own children overseas. Partly because of its large number of cross-cultural marriages, Australia has a relatively high rate of international child abduction: Parents apply through the Hague Convention to seek the return of as many as 140 children a year.That legal process is notoriously complex. Some countries, like India, have never signed the Hague Convention. Before Japan agreed to the pact in 2014, it had such a poor record of returning children that it became known as a “black hole” for child abduction. And even when both countries involved in a custody dispute have joined the treaty, the process can take years to unfold. In many Hague cases, countries side with their own citizens, regardless of the evidence.It’s those weaknesses and inconsistencies that drive some parents to seek a high-stakes shortcut: snatching their children back. There is no official tally of the number of companies purporting to offer “child recovery” services, or of the number of parents who use them. But interviews with child advocacy groups, law-enforcement officials and the companies themselves suggest that the industry is small: a dozen or so agencies active over the last decade, usually executing only a handful of operations a year.For everyone involved, the industry is fraught with dangers, from scams and scuffles to botched border crossings and international arrests, according to nearly 50 interviews with parents, psychologists, family lawyers, law enforcement officials and child abduction agents. Some agents say they work with local authorities to enforce family court orders. But often they intervene without hearing both sides of the story, sometimes bringing children back to parents who later lose custody in court or who have been accused of domestic violence. A snatchback, even a successful one, can be harmful to a child, leaving psychological scars that last into adulthood. And parents assume much of the risk: A company might conduct surveillance and plot an escape route but require the left-behind parent to physically grab the child.“It’s an unregulated industry, and we have seen things go very wrong,” said Vicky Mayes, a spokeswoman for Reunite, a British charity that helps parents of abducted children. “It’s just a massive risk for parents to take. It’s a big financial risk, and it’s a big safety risk for themselves and for their child.”For decades, many parents have worked with agents who have military experience, such as Gus Zamora, an ex-Army Ranger in Florida, and Michael Taylor, a former Green Beret best known for engineering the Nissan executive Carlos Ghosn’s escape from Japan. In recent years, others have turned to companies with names that evoke corporate power, like ABP World Group.Preston Findlay, a lawyer for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a Virginia nonprofit, keeps a stack of printouts about child abduction companies in a desk drawer. “Not everyone in that drawer is a straight-up concern,” Mr. Findlay said. “Sometimes it’s a group I’ve never heard of. Sometimes they pop up and change names. One group may post a picture that includes a guy who I’ve seen posted on another site.”Typically, child retrieval groups employ few full-time employees, more often delegating on-the-ground operations to freelancers paid by the day. Many agents advertise aggressively, announcing snatchbacks on social media, granting interviews to reporters, or denigrating industry rivals in long-winded blog posts. In 2015, two operatives for Child Recovery Australia cornered a man in a shopping mall in Malaysia while his ex-girlfriend, the Australian soap opera actress Eliza Szonert, grabbed their 6-year-old son. Mr. Chapman, the company’s founder, filmed the operation, and the video circulated in the Australian media. (Eventually, the father won sole custody in an Australian family court.)Over the years, a network of middlemen has developed within the industry — lawyers and advocacy groups who put desperate parents in touch with agents, sometimes for a fee. For more than a decade, Eric Kalmus, a Los Angeles businessman who was separated from his own child after he split up with his wife, served as a conduit between left-behind fathers and ex-soldiers who claimed to recover children. For $1,500, Mr. Kalmus would coach fathers to sweet-talk their estranged wives and, if that failed, would refer them to abduction agents in the United States or Europe. Occasionally an operation would collapse and the parent would turn on him.“I did this because I loved helping people,” Mr. Kalmus said. “Ninety percent of the time it’s great, and then something goes wrong, and I’m the devil. For $1,500, I’m the devil.”The agents themselves often charge much more, and for parents, the costs can be crippling. Kerry Bartlett, who works as a secretary at a hospital in the London area, sold her house to raise the roughly $60,000 she needed to extract her son and daughter from Northern Cyprus in 2017. When she returned to England with the children, she was homeless and had to move into a government hostel.“It was my only chance to get the kids out,” Ms. Bartlett said. “I didn’t want anyone to try to dissuade me.”Even a relatively straightforward operation can cost tens of thousands of dollars. In the spring of 2018, Keith Schafferius, a private investigator in Australia who claims to have recovered more than 100 children over several decades, was hired by an Australian father to get a kindergartner back from Lithuania. One morning, Mr. Schafferius waited outside the mother’s house until she emerged to take the child to school. “We took him off the street, and she screamed and shouted a bit, but we got back over the border,” said Mr. Schafferius, 78.“It was a fairly simple one,” he said. “I probably cleared about $15,000 out of that.”4. ‘That’s the difference between us and criminals’ImageBan Phai, Thailand.Credit...Adam Dean for The New York TimesNot long after the scrum at Holy Redeemer, Mr. Dempster sat in a cafe in Ban Phai, scribbling in a notebook. Once he had let go of N., the police had cut him loose. He was trying to stay positive. In the notebook, he made a list of everything that had gone well. His daughter had recognized him. He was not in trouble with the police.On a blank page, he wrote, “Next plan for N.’s return.”Back in Brisbane, he called Sean Felton, the founder of Abducted Angels, a British-based charity offering advice and legal assistance to the parents of kidnapped children. Mr. Felton advised him to contact an abduction agent named Adam Whittington.A former Australian soldier who later worked as a policeman in London, Mr. Whittington runs Child Abduction Recovery International, a company based in Sweden. He has successfully extracted children across Europe and Asia, once accosting a child’s grandparents in a quiet neighborhood in Poland. At 44, bald and baby-faced, he is personable and eager to please, always prepared with a colorful anecdote about some especially complex operation.He also has a history of embellishment. He once admitted to using stock images of photogenic children in some of his Facebook posts announcing snatchbacks, although he insisted the operations themselves were real. And four years ago, he orchestrated an abduction attempt that failed so spectacularly that it made headlines in Australia for months.In 2016, the Australian TV network Channel 9 paid Mr. Whittington more than $70,000 to extract the two children of an Australian mother named Sally Faulkner from Lebanon, where they were with their father. One day that April, a team working with Mr. Whittington seized the children off the street in a Hezbollah-controlled neighborhood of Beirut. “We work a lot in the Middle East,” Mr. Whittington said. “There’s a lot of corruption, which works well for us.” But the Lebanon operation ended in disaster: Before the children could leave the country, the local authorities arrested Ms. Faulkner, Mr. Whittington, and a Channel 9 news crew that had come along to document the operation.Mr. Whittington spent more than three months behind bars, until he was granted bail and allowed to return to Sweden. (Ms. Faulkner’s children remained in Lebanon with their father.) The botched recovery was embarrassing, and Mr. Whittington’s industry rivals seemed to sense an opportunity. Mr. Chapman, who had traded online insults with Mr. Whittington in the past, denounced Child Abduction Recovery International in the Australian media. “They’ve been a bit arrogant in their behavior,” he told one local journalist. “What were they thinking?”ImageAdam Whittington, the chief executive at Child Abduction Recovery International, in Taby, Sweden. He spent more than three months behind bars in Lebanon after a botched recovery.Credit...Mikael Sjoberg for The New York TimesAfter leaving prison, Mr. Whittington embarked on an aggressive campaign of retaliation. In long, rambling blog posts, he accused Mr. Chapman of sabotaging the Lebanon operation and claimed that various child abduction agents had scammed desperate parents. Mr. Chapman and the others responded with outrage, claiming that Mr. Whittington has exaggerated the number of children he has retrieved, lied about his finances and forged emails to cast aspersions on rivals.Mr. Whittington insists his critics are liars. But he freely admits that he has broken laws around the world, and brags about bribing police officers and border officials. In 2014, he was arrested during an operation in Singapore and accused of putting an elderly man in a headlock. “What we do is help kids,” Mr. Whittington said. “That’s the difference between us and criminals. Sometimes we’ll cross the line. But it’s not for a bad cause.”For all his ire online, Mr. Whittington can be a sensitive listener. When Mr. Dempster called, he was impressed with the agent’s calm demeanor and apparent professionalism. “I felt at ease,” Mr. Dempster said. “I slept better that night.”Before accepting a client, Mr. Whittington conducts a screening to weed out parents who are violent or abusive. He sends potential clients a detailed questionnaire, looks into their criminal histories, and asks for court orders regarding the custody of their children. Still, he acknowledges that a full background check is impossible. “We can’t pull skeletons out of people’s closets,” Mr. Whittington said. “There are many people who commit domestic violence but never get caught.”So he also relies on instincts he says he honed during his career in policing — that “funny feeling” he sometimes gets about people. Mr. Dempster quickly passed the test. “You could tell, even by talking to Stuart on the phone,” Mr. Whittington said. “He’s just a lovely guy.”5. ‘He must be a good man’In the beginning, Atchariya Chaloemmeeprasert also had a good feeling about Mr. Dempster. She met him on a dating website called Thai Love Link when she was in her 20s and had recently graduated college in Bangkok. Mr. Dempster, who was around twice her age and had never been married, told her he was hoping to meet women in Thailand. He was the only foreign man she knew, and at first, she exchanged messages with him mainly to practice her English. Eventually, though, their conversations turned intimate. Mr. Dempster promised to visit her family in Ban Phai, and she was impressed when he followed through.“I thought, ‘Oh, he must be a good man,’” recalled Ms. Atchariya, a deeply Christian woman who goes by the nickname Tan. “We could talk and understand each other. It’s so easy to make him smile.”The couple got engaged in Thailand, and when she was about six months pregnant, Ms. Atchariya went to live with Mr. Dempster in Wanganui, New Zealand, where N. was born in March 2008. The family moved periodically, first to the city of Darwin in northern Australia and later to Brisbane. Most of the time, Ms. Atchariya stayed home to take care of N. while Mr. Dempster coached. But they sometimes struggled financially, she said. For a while, she worked at a massage parlor and picked strawberries.Mr. Dempster and Ms. Atchariya give strikingly divergent accounts of their marriage. When they lived together, she said, Mr. Dempster was different from the charming man who had visited her in Ban Phai. Sometimes, he would fly into a rage and smash dishes or chairs. He also turned on her, she said, kicking her so hard that he left marks. One day in Darwin, he threw a dish against the wall and started strangling her, she said. When his grip loosened, she picked up N. and fled to a neighbor’s house, and then a women’s shelter. Later, she said, Mr. Dempster wrote a letter asking her to come back, and she agreed. “I wanted to have a full family,” she said.While they were living in Brisbane in 2012, she suspected Mr. Dempster was seeing other women. During one argument, she said, she waved a knife at him, and he filed a complaint with the local authorities, seeking a domestic violence order — a legal document in Australia that essentially serves as a restraining order. Not long after, she responded in kind, filing her own complaint in January 2013, with the help of a friend from church.At the time, Ms. Atchariya had already scheduled a flight to Thailand with N. to visit her family. She decided not to return. When Mr. Dempster found out she was staying in Ban Phai, she said, he told her, “Do not think you win.”“He thought it was a competition,” Ms. Atchariya said. “I did not think that way. I just wanted to get away from that situation.”Mr. Dempster denies that he ever abused or cheated on Ms. Atchariya. He accuses her of “playacting.” When she ran out of the house in Darwin, he said, it was after a verbal argument, not a physical assault. In fact, Mr. Dempster said, he sometimes feared for his own safety, and for their daughter’s. Ms. Atchariya did not merely wave a knife in his direction, he said; she threw one that narrowly missed his leg.Both Mr. Chapman and Mr. Whittington claim they spoke about elements of Ms. Atchariya’s allegations with contacts in the Australian police, who assured them there was no evidence of abuse. But Mr. Dempster said he often worried that neighbors and other acquaintances would accept his wife’s version of the story.“You feel so helpless,” he said. “Because who’s going to believe the bloke?”6. Standoff at the embassyMr. Whittington took Mr. Dempster’s case for around $12,000. But it was months before they could try to abduct N. In May 2014, the Thai army toppled the civilian government in a coup d’état. It seemed like an inopportune moment to sneak a child across an international border.After the attempted abduction before Christmas, N. returned to school in Ban Phai, where she studied English as part of a bilingual program. She lived with her extended family in a white, two-story house with a balcony overlooking a tree-lined street. Meanwhile, Mr. Whittington was laying the groundwork for another snatchback. He traveled to Ban Phai and installed a tracking device on a car belonging to Ms. Atchariya’s mother. By January 2015, he believed he had enough information to grab N., and he and Mr. Dempster returned to Ban Phai.ImageA classroom at Holy Redeemer.Credit...Adam Dean for The New York TimesOne morning that month, dressed in dark clothing, the men crept into Ms. Atchariya’s yard. N. was by the back door, chatting with her grandmother, who was making breakfast in an outdoor cooking area. Around 7:30 a.m., the two men sprinted toward the house.“It was as if they emerged from the earth,” the grandmother said. As they approached, she pulled N. closer, but Mr. Dempster pushed her away and grabbed his daughter. Then he leapt over a fence and ran along a dirt road to the getaway car.“She’s given up, mate,” said Mr. Whittington, panting behind him. “She’s given up way too soon.”Ms. Atchariya was in the house getting her nephew ready for school when she heard her mother scream. She rushed outside, but Mr. Dempster and Mr. Whittington were gone. She was sure they were on their way out of Thailand. After calling the police, she began to pray. “If I didn’t find her,” she said, “I thought that my heart would have been broken to pieces.”On a hunch, Ms. Atchariya took a bus to Bangkok and made her way to the New Zealand Embassy, on the 14th floor of an office building. Sure enough, Mr. Dempster and Mr. Whittington had also headed there to get N.’s passport stamped. (The embassy declined to comment on its involvement.) Ms. Atchariya could see her daughter inside, drawing a picture of two people holding hands, next to a cross and a little heart. Embassy officials would not let her enter, so she called the police, who surrounded the building. The standoff lasted for hours. Finally, after the embassy closed around sunset, Mr. Dempster and Mr. Whittington emerged.“Just let her take N.,” Mr. Whittington told Mr. Dempster later, at the local police station, as he recently recalled. “We’ll get her.”To her mother’s relief, N., who was then almost 7, did not seem particularly shaken by the ordeal; Mr. Whittington had given her snacks and toys. Hoping to strike some kind of compromise, Ms. Atchariya and her family agreed to meet Mr. Dempster and Mr. Whittington at a Chinese restaurant later that week. “The confidence they had in me wasn’t high,” Mr. Dempster said. But Mr. Whittington had a story ready: Mr. Dempster would move to Thailand to teach English and coach. “I don’t care about Stuart, and I don’t care about Tan,” he told the family. “What we need to sit down here right now and try and negotiate is what’s best for N.”It was a convincing display. Ms. Atchariya liked the idea of N. growing up with a father. Oddly, she also trusted Mr. Whittington. He had presented himself as a couples mediator, rather than a child extraction specialist. “Adam was an OK man,” she said. “He was a smart guy.” She agreed to let her husband spend a few days a week with N., as long as he handed over his passport before each visit. “But in the end,” she said, “all the good deeds I did gave me nothing back.”When Mr. Dempster returned to Ban Phai, he came with two passports.7. A blurry line between incompetence and fraudIn an industry in which some of the more successful figures have spent time in prison, it can be difficult to tell who is legitimate. Parents frustrated with the legal process and desperate to recover their children are vulnerable to fraud. “This is the nature of the beast,” Mr. Whittington said. “You get vulnerable parents, you’re going to have sharks and scammers.”In March 2017, a Brooklyn man named Peter Senese was sentenced to three years in prison for defrauding the parents of abducted children. He had collected more than $70,000 from a mother in New York, claiming that he and a team of operatives were in India tracking down her son. In reality, Mr. Senese and his girlfriend were on vacation in Miami.Walter Wright, an F.B.I. agent who investigated international child abductions during a 25-year career, arrested Mr. Senese at his parents’ home in Brooklyn. As he drove him into Manhattan, Mr. Wright recalled, Mr. Senese started bragging about rescuing children, including one he claimed to have recovered from a cage in Macau. “He’d heard about me and my reputation,” Mr. Wright said, “and he considered us peers.” When investigators examined Mr. Senese’s travel records, they found that he had not left the United States in years.“There probably could be a lot more cases brought,” said Jaimie Nawaday, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York who prosecuted Mr. Senese. “That whole industry is very shrouded in secrecy. They have to be breaking laws left and right.”Sometimes the line between incompetence and outright fraud can be unclear. In 2017, one American father paid an abduction agent more than $55,000 to retrieve his then-3-year-old son from a country in East Asia. But the agent backed out at the last minute, according to an affidavit the father later filed with local authorities, claiming that it was too risky to take the child and that he couldn’t offer a refund because he had already spent the money paying his operatives on the ground.ImageColin Chapman near his home in Maroochydore, Queensland, Australia.

Mr. Chapman, for example, says that it was Mr. Dempster’s idea to remove N. from school before Christmas 2013 and that Mr. Stilla followed him into the building reluctantly. (Mr. Dempster denies this, and Mr. Stilla did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) But Mr. Chapman said he did not fault his contractor for agreeing to help Mr. Dempster take N.“People have questioned me — why did Brad do it?” Mr. Chapman said. “I wouldn’t sit in a car and let the bloke do it on his own, either. I’d feel like a coward. And who wants him to do it on his own and be successful? You want to be there, just in case the prick pulls it off.”8. Sneaking across the borderThere was no tug of war. No snatch in the garden, no sprint to a getaway car. The third time Mr. Dempster fled with his daughter, near the end of April 2015, he picked her up for one of their regular visits and handed over an expired passport to N.’s grandmother. He never retrieved it. Instead, he walked the girl to where Mr. Whittington was parked, waiting to drive them away.After the failed abduction in January, it seemed unwise to take N. to a major Thai airport. So Mr. Whittington drove several hours to a checkpoint on the border between Thailand and Cambodia. The plan was for Mr. Dempster to fly with N. from Cambodia to Vietnam and on to Australia.But after passing through the Thai side, Mr. Dempster and N. were turned away by Cambodian border officials, who said there was a problem with their travel documents. Stranded at the border crossing, Mr. Dempster grew flustered. He was attracting attention from locals, who glared at him and N. suspiciously. One woman asked why the girl’s mother wasn’t with them. Mr. Dempster called Mr. Whittington, and they reconvened at another spot near the border.Mr. Whittington told Mr. Dempster to catch a domestic flight to Udon Thani, a city in northeastern Thailand near the border with Laos. There, Mr. Whittington said, they would meet a local fixer whom he knew from other operations. “Honest, Stuart,” Mr. Whittington said, “I wouldn’t trust this with anybody that I didn’t trust myself.”At the airport, a man in shorts and sandals greeted Mr. Dempster and N. and ushered them into a Toyota Land Cruiser. “It was like something out of an espionage movie,” Mr. Dempster said. The fixer took them to a spot along the Mekong River, which forms the border between Thailand and Laos, where a flat boat was waiting to transport them. “If you get caught doing things like that, you can get slung in jail for a long time,” Mr. Dempster said. But he climbed inside anyway, his back toward Laos, with N. sitting in front of him and two suitcases perched precariously beside them. Facing backward, Mr. Dempster could not tell how much farther the boat had to travel. “It was a bit unstable,” he recalled. “Every time I would look over, it would shift the boat, so I was going, ‘Oh, God. Where’s the riverbank?’”The boat reached land safely, and Mr. Dempster was delighted to be out of Thailand. He had always taken a dim view of the country’s culture. Laos felt different. The street signs were in French. The architecture was reassuringly Western. “I felt more at home there, or more comfortable there, because Laos had been colonized by the French, and it had done them a lot of good,” Mr. Dempster said. “Thailand has never been occupied by anyone.”A few days later, Mr. Dempster and N. flew to Australia. Mr. Whittington sent Ms. Atchariya a thumbs-up emoji — a message she interpreted as a taunt. (He says he was simply assuring her that the girl had made the trip safely.) Mr. Whittington also announced N.’s return in a May 7 Facebook post, claiming that she had been living in “terrible conditions and undernourished” in Thailand.ImageMs. Atchariya has not seen her daughter since April 2015. “Why did God allow this to happen?” she said.Credit...Adam Dean for The New York TimesMs. Atchariya said her daughter was always safe and well cared-for. “They insult my country,” she said. After the snatchback, she fell into a deep depression. She took down decorations in N.’s bedroom and avoided looking at photographs of her. Ms. Atchariya said that she has tried to get in touch with Mr. Dempster, to no avail. (Mr. Dempster said he has not heard from her.)For a while, losing N. made Ms. Atchariya question her faith. “Why did God allow this to happen?” she asked. “Why didn’t God sympathize with me?” She and her mother visited a fortune teller, hoping to find some kind of spiritual anchor, but no one could make N. reappear. These days, Ms. Atchariya teaches kindergarten in Ban Phai and runs a business selling health supplements. She considered going to Australia to track down N., but her mother told her it would be too dangerous. Every day, she prays that her daughter is safe. “Wherever she is,” she said, “I hope angels take care of her.”For the last five years, Mr. Dempster has raised N., now 12, on his own. At school, he told me, she recently won a public-speaking award and was invited to serve on a student leadership board. He said he does not regret circumventing the legal process to take her to Australia. “My poor daughter would be 12 and stuck in Thailand if I’d gone by the rules — the so-called rules,” he told me. “Or the right side of the law — so-called.”Psychologists say that memories of snatches can haunt children into adulthood, making them reluctant to start serious relationships or fearful that their own children might face similar traumas. N. has seen a therapist, but Mr. Dempster said he himself avoids raising the subject of her return from Thailand. “I’d rather it came from her,” he said. “If it comes from me, it looks like I’m trying to prove a point or something.”Still, he wants to make sure she hears his side of the story. In 2018, he set up a blog chronicling the first two snatchback attempts, as well as the collapse of his marriage to Ms. Atchariya and her allegations of domestic violence. “I would like N. to have the opportunity to read the stories here,” he wrote in an April 2018 post. “When she is capable, and in her own time, I would like her to make her own mind up about what happened.”Ryn Jirenuwat contributed reporting.

Mr. Dempster, a 55-year-old track and field coach from Australia, was accompanied by a tall, burly security contractor. The two men were preparing to abduct Mr. Dempster’s daughter.As they sped north, winding past the mountain-rimmed Lam Takhong reservoir and Khao Yai National Park, Mr. Dempster wasn’t sure what to expect. He had not seen his 5-year-old, N., in almost a year. At home in Brisbane, he had agreed to spend several thousand dollars to hire the contractor, Brad Stilla, through a company called Child Recovery Australia, one of a handful of agencies that reunite parents with children taken by estranged partners. Mr. Stilla met Mr. Dempster at a hotel in Bangkok, after flying in from China, and boasted that he knew kung fu.ImageThe Holy Redeemer Ban Phai School, in northeastern Thailand. When an attempted abduction caused panic, Colin Chapman, who was monitoring the scene by phone, told his operative: “How much cash have you got on you? Start waving that around.”Credit...Adam Dean for The New York TimesAfter several hours, the car pulled up outside Holy Redeemer Ban Phai School, a private Catholic academy on a busy, tree-lined street in the center of town. Mr. Dempster and Mr. Stilla walked toward the entrance — a wide, airy atrium next to a basketball court. Mr. Dempster felt a nervous sensation in his stomach, the way he often did before important races. Inside the school, he asked where he could find N., and a teacher pointed toward a classroom up a flight of stairs. He wondered whether his daughter would recognize him.Eleven months earlier, Mr. Dempster’s wife, a Thai woman named Atchariya Chaloemmeeprasert, had taken N. to Ban Phai to visit relatives. It was an unhappy time in the marriage: With a 24-year age difference, they argued often and had been sleeping in separate bedrooms. During her trip to Ban Phai, Ms. Atchariya never called home. The day she was scheduled to fly back, her uncle, a Scot who ran a business in Thailand, told Mr. Dempster that she no longer wanted to speak with him. She planned to remain in Ban Phai with their daughter.“It was difficult to think straight,” Mr. Dempster recalled. “I just thought, ‘Have I done anything wrong?’ Nobody’s perfect, and there’s no hard-and-fast rule for bringing kids up or for relationships. But I had done nothing to justify that.”There is often little the local police or family courts can do when one parent takes a child overseas without the other parent’s permission. But in Australia, the United States and dozens of other countries, the parent who is left behind can seek the child’s return under a 1980 international treaty, the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Countries that adopt the pact agree to help resolve international parental abduction cases by returning children to their “habitual residence,” where local family courts can determine custody.ImageN.’s mother, Atchariya Chaloemmeeprasert, at her home in Ban Phai. “If I didn’t find her,” she said, about one thwarted abduction, “I thought that my heart would have been broken to pieces.”Credit...Adam Dean for The New York TimesIn early 2013, not long after N. vanished into Thailand, Mr. Dempster contacted the Australian attorney general’s office to seek his daughter’s return. He soon became frustrated with the process. The paperwork was complicated. His caseworker was slow to return his messages. And once the Australian government broached the issue with Thailand, local authorities claimed they could not locate Ms. Atchariya. “It’s a failed system,” Mr. Dempster said. “It fails us all the time.”As the months passed, Mr. Dempster started considering another option. He had read online about bounty hunters who retrieve abducted children — an entire industry of self-proclaimed “recovery agents” who operate in legal and ethical gray zones, snatching children off the street in foreign countries.A lawyer at the Australian attorney general’s office urged Mr. Dempster to avoid these groups, which often break the law, bribing police and smuggling children across borders. Some parents have lost tens of thousands of dollars to agents who turned out to be dishonest or inept. Even a successful “recovery” can put a child in harm’s way. “Two wrongs don’t make a right,” the lawyer told him.But Mr. Dempster was impressed by the website of Child Recovery Australia. In late 2013, he traveled along Australia’s Sunshine Coast to meet the company’s founder, a silver-haired private investigator named Colin Chapman, who got his start tracking children for an Australian television network in the 1990s. After listening to Mr. Dempster’s story, Mr. Chapman showed him images of Ban Phai on Google Earth and explained how to obtain a new passport for his daughter.He said he could arrange a recovery for around $14,000. He told Mr. Dempster to meet Mr. Stilla in Thailand.2. ‘Help me! I can’t breathe.’When Mr. Dempster peered inside the classroom at Holy Redeemer, he immediately spotted N. at a desk by the window. He picked her up and walked out as Mr. Stilla followed, talking by phone with Mr. Chapman, who was overseeing the operation from Australia. “All right,” Mr. Stilla said, in Mr. Chapman’s recollection. “This is good.”But the sight of two foreigners removing a small child caused alarm at Holy Redeemer. Taweerart Nilda had taught at the school since Ms. Atchariya and her older brothers attended decades earlier, and she followed Mr. Dempster and Mr. Stilla as they hurried out. She tried to ask what was happening, but Mr. Stilla brushed her away. “They walked in as if they had authority,” she recalled. “They did not care about anything.”ImageTaweerart Nilda, one of N.’s former teachers at Ban Phai Holy Redeemer, tried to stop a kidnapping.Credit...Adam Dean for The New York TimesOutside, it was a typical Thai winter day — about 70 degrees, with a clear blue sky. Some older students were playing soccer. Ms. Taweerart and a few other teachers followed Mr. Dempster and Mr. Stilla through the courtyard, past a statue of Jesus underneath a red-and-white awning. By the time Mr. Dempster and Mr. Stilla reached the street, a crowd was beginning to form. The driver refused to open the car door. Ms. Taweerart started pulling N. from Mr. Dempster’s arms. She recalls the girl screaming in Thai: “Help me! I can’t breathe.”Still on the phone with Mr. Chapman, Mr. Stilla made a futile attempt to use his bulky frame to fend off the teachers and explain that N. was Mr. Dempster’s daughter. “Now what do I do?” he said into his phone.“How much cash have you got on you?” Mr. Chapman responded. “Start waving that around.”The confrontation was escalating. Police officers had appeared on the scene. One reached toward Mr. Dempster, who tried to elbow him away, only for the force of the crowd to push them even closer together. A group of male teachers grappled with Mr. Dempster, trying to wrest N. from his arms.“How long can you hold onto a kid?” Mr. Dempster told me recently. “It was a tug of war, and I thought, ‘This is too much stress for her.’ So I let go.”3. The child abduction industryImageSome of N.’s favorite clothes and her backpack.Credit...Adam Dean for The New York TimesWhen people think of kidnappers, they often imagine strangers in dark vans, luring young victims with candy. But most child abduction in the United States happens within families. In 2019, the State Department reported nearly 500 new abduction cases in which parents took their own children overseas. Partly because of its large number of cross-cultural marriages, Australia has a relatively high rate of international child abduction: Parents apply through the Hague Convention to seek the return of as many as 140 children a year.That legal process is notoriously complex. Some countries, like India, have never signed the Hague Convention. Before Japan agreed to the pact in 2014, it had such a poor record of returning children that it became known as a “black hole” for child abduction. And even when both countries involved in a custody dispute have joined the treaty, the process can take years to unfold. In many Hague cases, countries side with their own citizens, regardless of the evidence.It’s those weaknesses and inconsistencies that drive some parents to seek a high-stakes shortcut: snatching their children back. There is no official tally of the number of companies purporting to offer “child recovery” services, or of the number of parents who use them. But interviews with child advocacy groups, law-enforcement officials and the companies themselves suggest that the industry is small: a dozen or so agencies active over the last decade, usually executing only a handful of operations a year.For everyone involved, the industry is fraught with dangers, from scams and scuffles to botched border crossings and international arrests, according to nearly 50 interviews with parents, psychologists, family lawyers, law enforcement officials and child abduction agents. Some agents say they work with local authorities to enforce family court orders. But often they intervene without hearing both sides of the story, sometimes bringing children back to parents who later lose custody in court or who have been accused of domestic violence. A snatchback, even a successful one, can be harmful to a child, leaving psychological scars that last into adulthood. And parents assume much of the risk: A company might conduct surveillance and plot an escape route but require the left-behind parent to physically grab the child.“It’s an unregulated industry, and we have seen things go very wrong,” said Vicky Mayes, a spokeswoman for Reunite, a British charity that helps parents of abducted children. “It’s just a massive risk for parents to take. It’s a big financial risk, and it’s a big safety risk for themselves and for their child.”For decades, many parents have worked with agents who have military experience, such as Gus Zamora, an ex-Army Ranger in Florida, and Michael Taylor, a former Green Beret best known for engineering the Nissan executive Carlos Ghosn’s escape from Japan. In recent years, others have turned to companies with names that evoke corporate power, like ABP World Group.Preston Findlay, a lawyer for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a Virginia nonprofit, keeps a stack of printouts about child abduction companies in a desk drawer. “Not everyone in that drawer is a straight-up concern,” Mr. Findlay said. “Sometimes it’s a group I’ve never heard of. Sometimes they pop up and change names. One group may post a picture that includes a guy who I’ve seen posted on another site.”Typically, child retrieval groups employ few full-time employees, more often delegating on-the-ground operations to freelancers paid by the day. Many agents advertise aggressively, announcing snatchbacks on social media, granting interviews to reporters, or denigrating industry rivals in long-winded blog posts. In 2015, two operatives for Child Recovery Australia cornered a man in a shopping mall in Malaysia while his ex-girlfriend, the Australian soap opera actress Eliza Szonert, grabbed their 6-year-old son. Mr. Chapman, the company’s founder, filmed the operation, and the video circulated in the Australian media. (Eventually, the father won sole custody in an Australian family court.)Over the years, a network of middlemen has developed within the industry — lawyers and advocacy groups who put desperate parents in touch with agents, sometimes for a fee. For more than a decade, Eric Kalmus, a Los Angeles businessman who was separated from his own child after he split up with his wife, served as a conduit between left-behind fathers and ex-soldiers who claimed to recover children. For $1,500, Mr. Kalmus would coach fathers to sweet-talk their estranged wives and, if that failed, would refer them to abduction agents in the United States or Europe. Occasionally an operation would collapse and the parent would turn on him.“I did this because I loved helping people,” Mr. Kalmus said. “Ninety percent of the time it’s great, and then something goes wrong, and I’m the devil. For $1,500, I’m the devil.”The agents themselves often charge much more, and for parents, the costs can be crippling. Kerry Bartlett, who works as a secretary at a hospital in the London area, sold her house to raise the roughly $60,000 she needed to extract her son and daughter from Northern Cyprus in 2017. When she returned to England with the children, she was homeless and had to move into a government hostel.“It was my only chance to get the kids out,” Ms. Bartlett said. “I didn’t want anyone to try to dissuade me.”Even a relatively straightforward operation can cost tens of thousands of dollars. In the spring of 2018, Keith Schafferius, a private investigator in Australia who claims to have recovered more than 100 children over several decades, was hired by an Australian father to get a kindergartner back from Lithuania. One morning, Mr. Schafferius waited outside the mother’s house until she emerged to take the child to school. “We took him off the street, and she screamed and shouted a bit, but we got back over the border,” said Mr. Schafferius, 78.“It was a fairly simple one,” he said. “I probably cleared about $15,000 out of that.”4. ‘That’s the difference between us and criminals’ImageBan Phai, Thailand.Credit...Adam Dean for The New York TimesNot long after the scrum at Holy Redeemer, Mr. Dempster sat in a cafe in Ban Phai, scribbling in a notebook. Once he had let go of N., the police had cut him loose. He was trying to stay positive. In the notebook, he made a list of everything that had gone well. His daughter had recognized him. He was not in trouble with the police.On a blank page, he wrote, “Next plan for N.’s return.”Back in Brisbane, he called Sean Felton, the founder of Abducted Angels, a British-based charity offering advice and legal assistance to the parents of kidnapped children. Mr. Felton advised him to contact an abduction agent named Adam Whittington.A former Australian soldier who later worked as a policeman in London, Mr. Whittington runs Child Abduction Recovery International, a company based in Sweden. He has successfully extracted children across Europe and Asia, once accosting a child’s grandparents in a quiet neighborhood in Poland. At 44, bald and baby-faced, he is personable and eager to please, always prepared with a colorful anecdote about some especially complex operation.He also has a history of embellishment. He once admitted to using stock images of photogenic children in some of his Facebook posts announcing snatchbacks, although he insisted the operations themselves were real. And four years ago, he orchestrated an abduction attempt that failed so spectacularly that it made headlines in Australia for months.In 2016, the Australian TV network Channel 9 paid Mr. Whittington more than $70,000 to extract the two children of an Australian mother named Sally Faulkner from Lebanon, where they were with their father. One day that April, a team working with Mr. Whittington seized the children off the street in a Hezbollah-controlled neighborhood of Beirut. “We work a lot in the Middle East,” Mr. Whittington said. “There’s a lot of corruption, which works well for us.” But the Lebanon operation ended in disaster: Before the children could leave the country, the local authorities arrested Ms. Faulkner, Mr. Whittington, and a Channel 9 news crew that had come along to document the operation.Mr. Whittington spent more than three months behind bars, until he was granted bail and allowed to return to Sweden. (Ms. Faulkner’s children remained in Lebanon with their father.) The botched recovery was embarrassing, and Mr. Whittington’s industry rivals seemed to sense an opportunity. Mr. Chapman, who had traded online insults with Mr. Whittington in the past, denounced Child Abduction Recovery International in the Australian media. “They’ve been a bit arrogant in their behavior,” he told one local journalist. “What were they thinking?”ImageAdam Whittington, the chief executive at Child Abduction Recovery International, in Taby, Sweden. He spent more than three months behind bars in Lebanon after a botched recovery.Credit...Mikael Sjoberg for The New York TimesAfter leaving prison, Mr. Whittington embarked on an aggressive campaign of retaliation. In long, rambling blog posts, he accused Mr. Chapman of sabotaging the Lebanon operation and claimed that various child abduction agents had scammed desperate parents. Mr. Chapman and the others responded with outrage, claiming that Mr. Whittington has exaggerated the number of children he has retrieved, lied about his finances and forged emails to cast aspersions on rivals.Mr. Whittington insists his critics are liars. But he freely admits that he has broken laws around the world, and brags about bribing police officers and border officials. In 2014, he was arrested during an operation in Singapore and accused of putting an elderly man in a headlock. “What we do is help kids,” Mr. Whittington said. “That’s the difference between us and criminals. Sometimes we’ll cross the line. But it’s not for a bad cause.”For all his ire online, Mr. Whittington can be a sensitive listener. When Mr. Dempster called, he was impressed with the agent’s calm demeanor and apparent professionalism. “I felt at ease,” Mr. Dempster said. “I slept better that night.”Before accepting a client, Mr. Whittington conducts a screening to weed out parents who are violent or abusive. He sends potential clients a detailed questionnaire, looks into their criminal histories, and asks for court orders regarding the custody of their children. Still, he acknowledges that a full background check is impossible. “We can’t pull skeletons out of people’s closets,” Mr. Whittington said. “There are many people who commit domestic violence but never get caught.”So he also relies on instincts he says he honed during his career in policing — that “funny feeling” he sometimes gets about people. Mr. Dempster quickly passed the test. “You could tell, even by talking to Stuart on the phone,” Mr. Whittington said. “He’s just a lovely guy.”5. ‘He must be a good man’In the beginning, Atchariya Chaloemmeeprasert also had a good feeling about Mr. Dempster. She met him on a dating website called Thai Love Link when she was in her 20s and had recently graduated college in Bangkok. Mr. Dempster, who was around twice her age and had never been married, told her he was hoping to meet women in Thailand. He was the only foreign man she knew, and at first, she exchanged messages with him mainly to practice her English. Eventually, though, their conversations turned intimate. Mr. Dempster promised to visit her family in Ban Phai, and she was impressed when he followed through.“I thought, ‘Oh, he must be a good man,’” recalled Ms. Atchariya, a deeply Christian woman who goes by the nickname Tan. “We could talk and understand each other. It’s so easy to make him smile.”The couple got engaged in Thailand, and when she was about six months pregnant, Ms. Atchariya went to live with Mr. Dempster in Wanganui, New Zealand, where N. was born in March 2008. The family moved periodically, first to the city of Darwin in northern Australia and later to Brisbane. Most of the time, Ms. Atchariya stayed home to take care of N. while Mr. Dempster coached. But they sometimes struggled financially, she said. For a while, she worked at a massage parlor and picked strawberries.Mr. Dempster and Ms. Atchariya give strikingly divergent accounts of their marriage. When they lived together, she said, Mr. Dempster was different from the charming man who had visited her in Ban Phai. Sometimes, he would fly into a rage and smash dishes or chairs. He also turned on her, she said, kicking her so hard that he left marks. One day in Darwin, he threw a dish against the wall and started strangling her, she said. When his grip loosened, she picked up N. and fled to a neighbor’s house, and then a women’s shelter. Later, she said, Mr. Dempster wrote a letter asking her to come back, and she agreed. “I wanted to have a full family,” she said.While they were living in Brisbane in 2012, she suspected Mr. Dempster was seeing other women. During one argument, she said, she waved a knife at him, and he filed a complaint with the local authorities, seeking a domestic violence order — a legal document in Australia that essentially serves as a restraining order. Not long after, she responded in kind, filing her own complaint in January 2013, with the help of a friend from church.At the time, Ms. Atchariya had already scheduled a flight to Thailand with N. to visit her family. She decided not to return. When Mr. Dempster found out she was staying in Ban Phai, she said, he told her, “Do not think you win.”“He thought it was a competition,” Ms. Atchariya said. “I did not think that way. I just wanted to get away from that situation.”Mr. Dempster denies that he ever abused or cheated on Ms. Atchariya. He accuses her of “playacting.” When she ran out of the house in Darwin, he said, it was after a verbal argument, not a physical assault. In fact, Mr. Dempster said, he sometimes feared for his own safety, and for their daughter’s. Ms. Atchariya did not merely wave a knife in his direction, he said; she threw one that narrowly missed his leg.Both Mr. Chapman and Mr. Whittington claim they spoke about elements of Ms. Atchariya’s allegations with contacts in the Australian police, who assured them there was no evidence of abuse. But Mr. Dempster said he often worried that neighbors and other acquaintances would accept his wife’s version of the story.“You feel so helpless,” he said. “Because who’s going to believe the bloke?”6. Standoff at the embassyMr. Whittington took Mr. Dempster’s case for around $12,000. But it was months before they could try to abduct N. In May 2014, the Thai army toppled the civilian government in a coup d’état. It seemed like an inopportune moment to sneak a child across an international border.After the attempted abduction before Christmas, N. returned to school in Ban Phai, where she studied English as part of a bilingual program. She lived with her extended family in a white, two-story house with a balcony overlooking a tree-lined street. Meanwhile, Mr. Whittington was laying the groundwork for another snatchback. He traveled to Ban Phai and installed a tracking device on a car belonging to Ms. Atchariya’s mother. By January 2015, he believed he had enough information to grab N., and he and Mr. Dempster returned to Ban Phai.ImageA classroom at Holy Redeemer.Credit...Adam Dean for The New York TimesOne morning that month, dressed in dark clothing, the men crept into Ms. Atchariya’s yard. N. was by the back door, chatting with her grandmother, who was making breakfast in an outdoor cooking area. Around 7:30 a.m., the two men sprinted toward the house.“It was as if they emerged from the earth,” the grandmother said. As they approached, she pulled N. closer, but Mr. Dempster pushed her away and grabbed his daughter. Then he leapt over a fence and ran along a dirt road to the getaway car.“She’s given up, mate,” said Mr. Whittington, panting behind him. “She’s given up way too soon.”Ms. Atchariya was in the house getting her nephew ready for school when she heard her mother scream. She rushed outside, but Mr. Dempster and Mr. Whittington were gone. She was sure they were on their way out of Thailand. After calling the police, she began to pray. “If I didn’t find her,” she said, “I thought that my heart would have been broken to pieces.”On a hunch, Ms. Atchariya took a bus to Bangkok and made her way to the New Zealand Embassy, on the 14th floor of an office building. Sure enough, Mr. Dempster and Mr. Whittington had also headed there to get N.’s passport stamped. (The embassy declined to comment on its involvement.) Ms. Atchariya could see her daughter inside, drawing a picture of two people holding hands, next to a cross and a little heart. Embassy officials would not let her enter, so she called the police, who surrounded the building. The standoff lasted for hours. Finally, after the embassy closed around sunset, Mr. Dempster and Mr. Whittington emerged.“Just let her take N.,” Mr. Whittington told Mr. Dempster later, at the local police station, as he recently recalled. “We’ll get her.”To her mother’s relief, N., who was then almost 7, did not seem particularly shaken by the ordeal; Mr. Whittington had given her snacks and toys. Hoping to strike some kind of compromise, Ms. Atchariya and her family agreed to meet Mr. Dempster and Mr. Whittington at a Chinese restaurant later that week. “The confidence they had in me wasn’t high,” Mr. Dempster said. But Mr. Whittington had a story ready: Mr. Dempster would move to Thailand to teach English and coach. “I don’t care about Stuart, and I don’t care about Tan,” he told the family. “What we need to sit down here right now and try and negotiate is what’s best for N.”It was a convincing display. Ms. Atchariya liked the idea of N. growing up with a father. Oddly, she also trusted Mr. Whittington. He had presented himself as a couples mediator, rather than a child extraction specialist. “Adam was an OK man,” she said. “He was a smart guy.” She agreed to let her husband spend a few days a week with N., as long as he handed over his passport before each visit. “But in the end,” she said, “all the good deeds I did gave me nothing back.”When Mr. Dempster returned to Ban Phai, he came with two passports.7. A blurry line between incompetence and fraudIn an industry in which some of the more successful figures have spent time in prison, it can be difficult to tell who is legitimate. Parents frustrated with the legal process and desperate to recover their children are vulnerable to fraud. “This is the nature of the beast,” Mr. Whittington said. “You get vulnerable parents, you’re going to have sharks and scammers.”In March 2017, a Brooklyn man named Peter Senese was sentenced to three years in prison for defrauding the parents of abducted children. He had collected more than $70,000 from a mother in New York, claiming that he and a team of operatives were in India tracking down her son. In reality, Mr. Senese and his girlfriend were on vacation in Miami.Walter Wright, an F.B.I. agent who investigated international child abductions during a 25-year career, arrested Mr. Senese at his parents’ home in Brooklyn. As he drove him into Manhattan, Mr. Wright recalled, Mr. Senese started bragging about rescuing children, including one he claimed to have recovered from a cage in Macau. “He’d heard about me and my reputation,” Mr. Wright said, “and he considered us peers.” When investigators examined Mr. Senese’s travel records, they found that he had not left the United States in years.“There probably could be a lot more cases brought,” said Jaimie Nawaday, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York who prosecuted Mr. Senese. “That whole industry is very shrouded in secrecy. They have to be breaking laws left and right.”Sometimes the line between incompetence and outright fraud can be unclear. In 2017, one American father paid an abduction agent more than $55,000 to retrieve his then-3-year-old son from a country in East Asia. But the agent backed out at the last minute, according to an affidavit the father later filed with local authorities, claiming that it was too risky to take the child and that he couldn’t offer a refund because he had already spent the money paying his operatives on the ground.ImageColin Chapman near his home in Maroochydore, Queensland, Australia.

Mr. Chapman, for example, says that it was Mr. Dempster’s idea to remove N. from school before Christmas 2013 and that Mr. Stilla followed him into the building reluctantly. (Mr. Dempster denies this, and Mr. Stilla did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) But Mr. Chapman said he did not fault his contractor for agreeing to help Mr. Dempster take N.“People have questioned me — why did Brad do it?” Mr. Chapman said. “I wouldn’t sit in a car and let the bloke do it on his own, either. I’d feel like a coward. And who wants him to do it on his own and be successful? You want to be there, just in case the prick pulls it off.”8. Sneaking across the borderThere was no tug of war. No snatch in the garden, no sprint to a getaway car. The third time Mr. Dempster fled with his daughter, near the end of April 2015, he picked her up for one of their regular visits and handed over an expired passport to N.’s grandmother. He never retrieved it. Instead, he walked the girl to where Mr. Whittington was parked, waiting to drive them away.After the failed abduction in January, it seemed unwise to take N. to a major Thai airport. So Mr. Whittington drove several hours to a checkpoint on the border between Thailand and Cambodia. The plan was for Mr. Dempster to fly with N. from Cambodia to Vietnam and on to Australia.But after passing through the Thai side, Mr. Dempster and N. were turned away by Cambodian border officials, who said there was a problem with their travel documents. Stranded at the border crossing, Mr. Dempster grew flustered. He was attracting attention from locals, who glared at him and N. suspiciously. One woman asked why the girl’s mother wasn’t with them. Mr. Dempster called Mr. Whittington, and they reconvened at another spot near the border.Mr. Whittington told Mr. Dempster to catch a domestic flight to Udon Thani, a city in northeastern Thailand near the border with Laos. There, Mr. Whittington said, they would meet a local fixer whom he knew from other operations. “Honest, Stuart,” Mr. Whittington said, “I wouldn’t trust this with anybody that I didn’t trust myself.”At the airport, a man in shorts and sandals greeted Mr. Dempster and N. and ushered them into a Toyota Land Cruiser. “It was like something out of an espionage movie,” Mr. Dempster said. The fixer took them to a spot along the Mekong River, which forms the border between Thailand and Laos, where a flat boat was waiting to transport them. “If you get caught doing things like that, you can get slung in jail for a long time,” Mr. Dempster said. But he climbed inside anyway, his back toward Laos, with N. sitting in front of him and two suitcases perched precariously beside them. Facing backward, Mr. Dempster could not tell how much farther the boat had to travel. “It was a bit unstable,” he recalled. “Every time I would look over, it would shift the boat, so I was going, ‘Oh, God. Where’s the riverbank?’”The boat reached land safely, and Mr. Dempster was delighted to be out of Thailand. He had always taken a dim view of the country’s culture. Laos felt different. The street signs were in French. The architecture was reassuringly Western. “I felt more at home there, or more comfortable there, because Laos had been colonized by the French, and it had done them a lot of good,” Mr. Dempster said. “Thailand has never been occupied by anyone.”A few days later, Mr. Dempster and N. flew to Australia. Mr. Whittington sent Ms. Atchariya a thumbs-up emoji — a message she interpreted as a taunt. (He says he was simply assuring her that the girl had made the trip safely.) Mr. Whittington also announced N.’s return in a May 7 Facebook post, claiming that she had been living in “terrible conditions and undernourished” in Thailand.ImageMs. Atchariya has not seen her daughter since April 2015. “Why did God allow this to happen?” she said.Credit...Adam Dean for The New York TimesMs. Atchariya said her daughter was always safe and well cared-for. “They insult my country,” she said. After the snatchback, she fell into a deep depression. She took down decorations in N.’s bedroom and avoided looking at photographs of her. Ms. Atchariya said that she has tried to get in touch with Mr. Dempster, to no avail. (Mr. Dempster said he has not heard from her.)For a while, losing N. made Ms. Atchariya question her faith. “Why did God allow this to happen?” she asked. “Why didn’t God sympathize with me?” She and her mother visited a fortune teller, hoping to find some kind of spiritual anchor, but no one could make N. reappear. These days, Ms. Atchariya teaches kindergarten in Ban Phai and runs a business selling health supplements. She considered going to Australia to track down N., but her mother told her it would be too dangerous. Every day, she prays that her daughter is safe. “Wherever she is,” she said, “I hope angels take care of her.”For the last five years, Mr. Dempster has raised N., now 12, on his own. At school, he told me, she recently won a public-speaking award and was invited to serve on a student leadership board. He said he does not regret circumventing the legal process to take her to Australia. “My poor daughter would be 12 and stuck in Thailand if I’d gone by the rules — the so-called rules,” he told me. “Or the right side of the law — so-called.”Psychologists say that memories of snatches can haunt children into adulthood, making them reluctant to start serious relationships or fearful that their own children might face similar traumas. N. has seen a therapist, but Mr. Dempster said he himself avoids raising the subject of her return from Thailand. “I’d rather it came from her,” he said. “If it comes from me, it looks like I’m trying to prove a point or something.”Still, he wants to make sure she hears his side of the story. In 2018, he set up a blog chronicling the first two snatchback attempts, as well as the collapse of his marriage to Ms. Atchariya and her allegations of domestic violence. “I would like N. to have the opportunity to read the stories here,” he wrote in an April 2018 post. “When she is capable, and in her own time, I would like her to make her own mind up about what happened.”Ryn Jirenuwat contributed reporting.

There were 12 people in three bedrooms, with a bathroom whose door frequently required a knock and a kitchen where dinnertime shifts extended from 5 p.m. well into the evening.Karla Lorenzo, a Guatemalan immigrant who cleaned houses in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, lived in the big room along the driveway. Big is a relative term when a room has five people in it. She and her partner, Abel, slept in a queen-size bed along the wall. There was a crib for the baby at the foot, with the older children’s bunk bed next to that. The other housemates had similar layouts.Living among many people, as Ms. Lorenzo put it in Spanish, you cannot really avoid your housemates. The sounds, the smells, the moods — everyone is pressed against all of it, and they understood that if one of them got the coronavirus, the rest probably would.That happened in April, and now the house is returning to health. Abel, referred to by his first name because his immigration status is uncertain, is home after three weeks in the hospital, where Ms. Lorenzo feared he would die alone gasping for air. And she is no longer squirreled in the closet where she spent days to avoid giving the virus to the children.Now comes a second struggle: figuring out how to pay rent. Abel is back at work at a home supply store, but Ms. Lorenzo’s housecleaning jobs dried up and one of the other families moved out — increasing the monthly bill by $850. “We don’t know how we are going to do it,” she said.From the early outbreaks to the economic destruction that has come after, the coronavirus pandemic has mapped itself onto America’s longstanding affordable housing problem and the gaping inequality that underlies it. To offset rising rents in a nation where one in four tenant households spend more than half of their pretax income on shelter, a multitude of low-wage service workers have piled into ever more crowded homes.ImageShoes sitting outside Karla Lorenzo’s home to disinfect.

Frank for The New York TimesImageSpace for parking is at a premium in her neighborhood.Credit...Jim McAuley for The New York TimesLiving in overstuffed units subdivided by hinged partitions and tacked-up sheets, these households — many of them retail and service workers who are unable to do their jobs from home — were acutely susceptible to the virus’s spread. With double-digit unemployment projected to persist through next year, the same families face losing the crowded homes that make it so easy to get sick in the first place.To combat the virus, Americans of every income are being encouraged to wear masks and keep their distance. But for low-income families who crowd together to stretch their budgets, home has its own risks.[Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]For these families, a good amount of the response has included triaging a decades-old shortage of affordable housing. Cities and states are renting hotel rooms for people who normally sleep on the streets. There are trailers to quarantine those whose apartments are too crowded for isolation. Fearing a wave of homelessness, governments have followed up with rental aid and moratoriums on evictions.Combined with federal stimulus funds, and $600 a week in supplemental unemployment benefits that have just lapsed, these measures have prevented the dire predictions of mass displacement. Congress is working on another emergency package, and property owners and affordable-housing advocates have pressed for direct rental assistance.But evictions are already ramping back up, and the longer the economic malaise continues, the more housing insecurity there will be. Some of the evicted will become homeless, but if the past is a guide, most are likely to find somewhere else to go, and that somewhere is likely to be overcrowded — compounding the conditions that make it so easy to spread the virus.“We have clients struggling to choose between living in an overcrowded home or facing eviction for not being able to make rent,” said Nazanin Salehi, a lawyer with the nonprofit group Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto. “No matter what they decide, the risk is more exposure to this virus.”\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Latest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak and the Economy\n  \n  \n  \n    4h ago\n    The latest: Under Armour announces layoffs, and Luby’s will liquidate.\n  \n    4h ago\n    Lululemon reports a quarterly profit as consumers flock to yoga pants.\n  \n    6h ago\n    The work-from-home challenge for employees of color.\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    See more updates\n  \n  \n    More live coverage:\n    \n      Global\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Sides of Silicon Valley\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tResidential overcrowding\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tShare of housing units within each census tract with more than one person per room\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t8\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t13\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t22\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t30\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t45%\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDanville\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOakland\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan\n\t\t\tFrancisco\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Leandro\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPleasanton\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Bruno\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHayward\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHillsborough\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Mateo\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRedwood\n\t\t\tCity\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEast Palo\n\t\t\tAlto\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHalf Moon\n\t\t\tBay\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFremont\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPalo Alto\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMilpitas\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMenlo\n\t\t\tPark\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMountain\n\t\t\tView\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSanta\n\t\t\tClara\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan\n\t\t\tJose\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCupertino\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHighways\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLos Gatos\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tResidential\n\t\t\tovercrowding\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDanville\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOakland\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan\n\t\t\tFrancisco\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tShare of housing units within each census tract with more than one person per room\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Leandro\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDaly City\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPleasanton\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t45\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t%\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHayward\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Bruno\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMillbrae\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHillsborough\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Mateo\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRedwood\n\t\t\tCity\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t30\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHalf\n\t\t\tMoon\n\t\t\tBay\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEast Palo\n\t\t\tAlto\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFremont\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPalo Alto\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMilpitas\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMenlo\n\t\t\tPark\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t22\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMountain\n\t\t\tView\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSunnyvale\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSanta\n\t\t\tClara\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan\n\t\t\tJose\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t13\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCupertino\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t8\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHighways\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLos Gatos\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Census BureauBy Karl RussellVisitors to Silicon Valley may take a wrong turn or freeway exit on the way to this or that office park and find themselves in an area like the North Central neighborhood of San Mateo, Calif. That is where Ms. Lorenzo lives on a block of faded homes on small lots, with packed driveways and cars parked liberally on the sidewalk. The scene is one side of the tech economy.For much of the peninsula stretching south from San Francisco, there is a rough economic split. Cities and neighborhoods to the east, places like East Palo Alto, North Fair Oaks and the Belle Haven section of Menlo Park, are more overcrowded and have a larger share of low-income and Black and Latino residents, many of whom have been disproportionately affected by the virus. Towns and neighborhoods to the west, places like Hillsborough and Palo Alto, are whiter and rich.This geography is as fundamental to how the place operates as the invention of the microchip. Every day, throngs of clerks, landscapers and elder-care workers wake up on the eastern parts and travel to homes on the western parts or to the corporate campuses of tech companies to do subcontracting work. And every night, they return to overcrowded homes.Ms. Lorenzo was one of them. She immigrated to the United States six years ago from Guatemala with her two children, fleeing a broken relationship and looking for a new start. Now she is a green-card holder with a new partner and a 2-year-old. Until the pandemic hit, she made about $16 an hour mopping floors and vacuuming carpets in homes on the other side of the peninsula.For a while, her wages and Abel’s were enough for their own small place — a $1,600-a-month studio that had a bed for them and a shared mattress for the children. Then the rent jumped to $2,100. And then to $2,650.The couple went looking for cheaper housing and roommates, a quest that has become a Bay Area ritual. Since the Great Recession, a growing share of Bay Area movers, from all but the most well-off households, have gone to homes with four or more adults from ones with one or two adults, according to a study by researchers at Stanford University and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.The high-end version is dressed up with a description like “co-living” or explained as a culturally in-tune couple sacrificing an extra bedroom in the suburbs for a life of less driving closer to the city. The low-end version is poverty. Whatever it is called, the economic calculus is the same.Wages are higher in coastal California than in inland areas, where housing is cheaper, so all but the very rich have to make a trade-off between a commute and space. It is just that the choices for poorer workers are more extreme, like a three-hour commute from cities like Stockton or huddling together in homes where nearly every space is the site of someone’s bed.ImageHillsborough is one of the wealthy towns near Silicon Valley with demand for service work.Credit...Jim McAuley for The New York TimesImageSan Mateo’s North Central neighborhood is part of the San Francisco Peninsula’s denser east side.Credit...Jim McAuley for The New York TimesResearchers define extreme overcrowding as any home that is occupied by more than one person for every room without a toilet. By this measurement, overcrowding has increased nationwide since the mid-2000s, and the problem is particularly acute in California. About 13.4 percent of rental units — more than double the national average — were considered overcrowded in 2018, according to the Census Bureau. San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties, which roughly outline Silicon Valley, have one of the world’s densest concentrations of billionaires as well as some of the country’s most overcrowded homes.After the studio, Ms. Lorenzo found a $1,250-a-month room in her current home, a blue stucco house at the back of a two-unit lot, with chalk drawings on the driveway and a dirt yard in the back. There were 11 occupants after Ms. Lorenzo moved in, 12 after her younger child was born.Dividing the rent had benefits, like allowing Ms. Lorenzo to save money and buy her first television. The children’s shared mattress from the studio was replaced with a new bunk bed. “More clothes, more shoes for the children,” she said, “because we were limited in many things.”The catch was living with personalities, rules and understandings. Cooking privileges were on a first-come basis, which meant that the last family to use the kitchen might not eat until 9:30 p.m. There was no official time limit on the bathroom, but people knew to be fast. If anyone got a cold, everyone was exposed.Crowded homes have been a concern practically as long as public health has been a field. Living with a pile of roommates has long been associated with faster-spreading infections, inescapable stress, irregular sleep and the effects that follow, including higher blood pressure and weakened immune systems.But those take years to develop. The coronavirus spreads in days. By moving so fast and furiously, the virus has exposed in weeks something doctors have been worried about for generations, said Dr. Margot Kushel, an internist and director of the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at the University of California, San Francisco. “Covid has really become a story of essential workers living in crowded housing,” she said.Games in the ClosetImageSaving on rent by sharing a home meant Karla Lorenzo could spend more on her children’s needs. But it also brought tensions with other tenants, along with the health risks of overcrowding.Credit...Brian L. Frank for The New York TimesThe sickness began, as it does, with worry.In mid-April, after schools shut down and the children were sent home with worksheets, Abel returned from his job with a report that two of his co-workers had been out sick. He showered with the garden hose and slept in the car that night. But it was too late.His symptoms were initially mild, before escalating to a 104-degree fever and a shortness of breath that prompted Ms. Lorenzo to take him to the hospital. The county health department, worried that a crowded home would accelerate the spread of what was confirmed to be the coronavirus, dispatched a case worker to test everyone in the house, Ms. Lorenzo said. Eight — all except her children — were also positive.Ms. Lorenzo never got more than a headache and a sore throat, which in normal times would not have even prevented her from going to work. Suddenly she had to isolate herself in a house where everything was shared.She settled on the closet, running a phone charger under the door and sitting there for six to eight hours a day, playing word games on her phone, calling relatives in Guatemala, sometimes just napping. Her 10-year-old son took over cooking meals and changing diapers. All the while, Abel was in the hospital. Improving or worsening, alive or dead, Ms. Lorenzo had no idea.“There was no communication with him, so my head was spinning,” she said.ImageMs. Lorenzo's children were the only ones living at the house who avoided getting the coronavirus.Credit...Brian L. Frank for The New York TimesMs. Lorenzo sprayed down the bathroom whenever she or the children used it. She avoided the kitchen and had her sister, who lives more than a half-hour away in Oakland, deliver food through the bedroom window. One time, the sister brought a thermos of hot coffee that Ms. Lorenzo said might as well have been hot water; the virus had so ruined her sense of taste that she could not tell the difference.Still, the house got tense. One of the housemates accused Abel of infecting them. She told Ms. Lorenzo that if anyone in her family died, she would figure out a way to sue her. After that came the silent treatment — “no hablaba” — and as house relations plummeted, Ms. Lorenzo feared she would be evicted with nowhere to go.After two weeks, a county health worker returned to test the house again. Ms. Lorenzo’s children were still negative, which seemed so unlikely, given the crowding, that the county retested them several times. All negative, she said. Worried that this luck would soon run out, the county moved her and the children to an emergency trailer.They lived there for nine days, leaving only to collect stale salad and sandwiches left on an outdoor table. When they finally went home, Abel was back from the hospital.Days of deep cleaning ensued. Ms. Lorenzo, back to health, is wondering when the world will return to some semblance of normality. Yet she feels lucky that things are not worse, because she thought her partner was going to die. “We are trying to cope with it,” she said. “Trying to leave everything in the past.”Crowding vs. DensityImageChelsea, Mass., had one of the nation’s worst coronavirus outbreaks. “It’s not how many people you run into on the street but how many people you see when you come home,” an affordable-housing provider there said.Credit...Brian Snyder/ReutersEarly in the outbreak, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and some commentators blamed dense housing and public transit for the spread of the virus. The proof seemed as intuitive as New York’s status as an early epicenter. The recent surge of cases in the more sprawling metropolitan areas of the South and the West has undercut that thesis, and a number of new studies suggest that density, the number of housing units per acre, is less important than crowding, the number of people per bedroom.One widely cited report was from New York University’s Furman Center, which found that infections were much more intense in Queens neighborhoods with high rates of overcrowding than in Manhattan neighborhoods with higher density but fewer people per unit. The link between crowding and transmission has since shown up in suburbs, rural America and Native American reservations. There is even some evidence that dense metropolitan counties, while suffering higher raw numbers of infections, have a lower death rate because it is easier to get to a hospital.San Mateo County has been a bright spot, with a rate of about 700 coronavirus cases per 100,000, about half the rate of the state. Still, the county’s cases have been concentrated in low-income households, with most coming lately from front-line workers who “live in crowded multigenerational conditions,” according to the county health officer.In Chelsea, Mass., which had one of the nation’s worst outbreaks, there is a compelling suggestion that less-crowded quarters can help control the spread. Sleeved into the same blocks where buildings were overrun with infection are 375 subsidized apartments owned by The Neighborhood Developers, a housing nonprofit. The 968 tenants are mostly nonwhite, have the same mix of low-paid service jobs as their neighbors, and live in multistory buildings. But their units are subsidized and less crowded — and so far, healthier.The Neighborhood Developers has had eight reported cases of the coronavirus in Chelsea, or 826 per 100,000 people, about a tenth the rate of the surrounding community. “It’s not how many people you run into on the street but how many people you see when you come home,” said Rafael Mares, executive director of The Neighborhood Developers.The story is tempered by its rarity. The United States has a deficit of seven million apartments available to the lowest-income households, or an average of 36 available affordable units for every 100 extremely low-income families in search of one, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.In April of last year, The Neighborhood Developers opened a five-story building with 34 apartments for homeless and low-income families. It received 3,598 applications.Rent Is DueImageBefore the pandemic, Ms. Lorenzo’s sister used three red-and-white coolers to sell ice cream on the street. Now they are stacked against a wall, a reminder of lost income.Credit...Brian L. Frank for The New York TimesStacked against a wall in Ms. Lorenzo’s living room are three red-and-white coolers that her sister used to fill with ice cream to sell on the street. They are furloughed because of the lack of demand and have become just another obstacle that her cooped-up children have to dodge while zipping around the house.Abel still gets headaches and a tremor in his left arm, but the virus is gone and he is well enough to work. Ms. Lorenzo has not cleaned a house since March but recently got a new job cleaning offices. The family has also been relying on nonprofit organizations and Christian charities for staples.Once a week Ms. Lorenzo joins the procession of cars that roll through a parking-lot food bank set up by Samaritan House, a San Mateo-based organization that has seen demand for food double and is spending $200,000 a week on rental assistance. Since April 1, 4,000 families have applied for some $8 million in assistance on rent and utilities “and it hasn’t even really hit yet,” said Bart Charlow, Samaritan House’s chief executive.Ms. Lorenzo’s name could soon be on the list.

There were 12 people in three bedrooms, with a bathroom whose door frequently required a knock and a kitchen where dinnertime shifts extended from 5 p.m. well into the evening.Karla Lorenzo, a Guatemalan immigrant who cleaned houses in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, lived in the big room along the driveway. Big is a relative term when a room has five people in it. She and her partner, Abel, slept in a queen-size bed along the wall. There was a crib for the baby at the foot, with the older children’s bunk bed next to that. The other housemates had similar layouts.Living among many people, as Ms. Lorenzo put it in Spanish, you cannot really avoid your housemates. The sounds, the smells, the moods — everyone is pressed against all of it, and they understood that if one of them got the coronavirus, the rest probably would.That happened in April, and now the house is returning to health. Abel, referred to by his first name because his immigration status is uncertain, is home after three weeks in the hospital, where Ms. Lorenzo feared he would die alone gasping for air. And she is no longer squirreled in the closet where she spent days to avoid giving the virus to the children.Now comes a second struggle: figuring out how to pay rent. Abel is back at work at a home supply store, but Ms. Lorenzo’s housecleaning jobs dried up and one of the other families moved out — increasing the monthly bill by $850. “We don’t know how we are going to do it,” she said.From the early outbreaks to the economic destruction that has come after, the coronavirus pandemic has mapped itself onto America’s longstanding affordable housing problem and the gaping inequality that underlies it. To offset rising rents in a nation where one in four tenant households spend more than half of their pretax income on shelter, a multitude of low-wage service workers have piled into ever more crowded homes.ImageShoes sitting outside Karla Lorenzo’s home to disinfect.

Frank for The New York TimesImageSpace for parking is at a premium in her neighborhood.Credit...Jim McAuley for The New York TimesLiving in overstuffed units subdivided by hinged partitions and tacked-up sheets, these households — many of them retail and service workers who are unable to do their jobs from home — were acutely susceptible to the virus’s spread. With double-digit unemployment projected to persist through next year, the same families face losing the crowded homes that make it so easy to get sick in the first place.To combat the virus, Americans of every income are being encouraged to wear masks and keep their distance. But for low-income families who crowd together to stretch their budgets, home has its own risks.[Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]For these families, a good amount of the response has included triaging a decades-old shortage of affordable housing. Cities and states are renting hotel rooms for people who normally sleep on the streets. There are trailers to quarantine those whose apartments are too crowded for isolation. Fearing a wave of homelessness, governments have followed up with rental aid and moratoriums on evictions.Combined with federal stimulus funds, and $600 a week in supplemental unemployment benefits that have just lapsed, these measures have prevented the dire predictions of mass displacement. Congress is working on another emergency package, and property owners and affordable-housing advocates have pressed for direct rental assistance.But evictions are already ramping back up, and the longer the economic malaise continues, the more housing insecurity there will be. Some of the evicted will become homeless, but if the past is a guide, most are likely to find somewhere else to go, and that somewhere is likely to be overcrowded — compounding the conditions that make it so easy to spread the virus.“We have clients struggling to choose between living in an overcrowded home or facing eviction for not being able to make rent,” said Nazanin Salehi, a lawyer with the nonprofit group Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto. “No matter what they decide, the risk is more exposure to this virus.”\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Latest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak and the Economy\n  \n  \n  \n    4h ago\n    The latest: Under Armour announces layoffs, and Luby’s will liquidate.\n  \n    4h ago\n    Lululemon reports a quarterly profit as consumers flock to yoga pants.\n  \n    6h ago\n    The work-from-home challenge for employees of color.\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    See more updates\n  \n  \n    More live coverage:\n    \n      Global\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Sides of Silicon Valley\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tResidential overcrowding\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tShare of housing units within each census tract with more than one person per room\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t8\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t13\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t22\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t30\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t45%\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDanville\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOakland\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan\n\t\t\tFrancisco\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Leandro\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPleasanton\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Bruno\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHayward\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHillsborough\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Mateo\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRedwood\n\t\t\tCity\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEast Palo\n\t\t\tAlto\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHalf Moon\n\t\t\tBay\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFremont\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPalo Alto\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMilpitas\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMenlo\n\t\t\tPark\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMountain\n\t\t\tView\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSanta\n\t\t\tClara\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan\n\t\t\tJose\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCupertino\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHighways\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLos Gatos\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tResidential\n\t\t\tovercrowding\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDanville\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOakland\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan\n\t\t\tFrancisco\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tShare of housing units within each census tract with more than one person per room\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Leandro\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDaly City\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPleasanton\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t45\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t%\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHayward\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Bruno\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMillbrae\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHillsborough\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Mateo\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRedwood\n\t\t\tCity\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t30\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHalf\n\t\t\tMoon\n\t\t\tBay\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEast Palo\n\t\t\tAlto\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFremont\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPalo Alto\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMilpitas\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMenlo\n\t\t\tPark\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t22\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMountain\n\t\t\tView\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSunnyvale\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSanta\n\t\t\tClara\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan\n\t\t\tJose\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t13\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCupertino\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t8\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHighways\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t3\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLos Gatos\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Census BureauBy Karl RussellVisitors to Silicon Valley may take a wrong turn or freeway exit on the way to this or that office park and find themselves in an area like the North Central neighborhood of San Mateo, Calif. That is where Ms. Lorenzo lives on a block of faded homes on small lots, with packed driveways and cars parked liberally on the sidewalk. The scene is one side of the tech economy.For much of the peninsula stretching south from San Francisco, there is a rough economic split. Cities and neighborhoods to the east, places like East Palo Alto, North Fair Oaks and the Belle Haven section of Menlo Park, are more overcrowded and have a larger share of low-income and Black and Latino residents, many of whom have been disproportionately affected by the virus. Towns and neighborhoods to the west, places like Hillsborough and Palo Alto, are whiter and rich.This geography is as fundamental to how the place operates as the invention of the microchip. Every day, throngs of clerks, landscapers and elder-care workers wake up on the eastern parts and travel to homes on the western parts or to the corporate campuses of tech companies to do subcontracting work. And every night, they return to overcrowded homes.Ms. Lorenzo was one of them. She immigrated to the United States six years ago from Guatemala with her two children, fleeing a broken relationship and looking for a new start. Now she is a green-card holder with a new partner and a 2-year-old. Until the pandemic hit, she made about $16 an hour mopping floors and vacuuming carpets in homes on the other side of the peninsula.For a while, her wages and Abel’s were enough for their own small place — a $1,600-a-month studio that had a bed for them and a shared mattress for the children. Then the rent jumped to $2,100. And then to $2,650.The couple went looking for cheaper housing and roommates, a quest that has become a Bay Area ritual. Since the Great Recession, a growing share of Bay Area movers, from all but the most well-off households, have gone to homes with four or more adults from ones with one or two adults, according to a study by researchers at Stanford University and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.The high-end version is dressed up with a description like “co-living” or explained as a culturally in-tune couple sacrificing an extra bedroom in the suburbs for a life of less driving closer to the city. The low-end version is poverty. Whatever it is called, the economic calculus is the same.Wages are higher in coastal California than in inland areas, where housing is cheaper, so all but the very rich have to make a trade-off between a commute and space. It is just that the choices for poorer workers are more extreme, like a three-hour commute from cities like Stockton or huddling together in homes where nearly every space is the site of someone’s bed.ImageHillsborough is one of the wealthy towns near Silicon Valley with demand for service work.Credit...Jim McAuley for The New York TimesImageSan Mateo’s North Central neighborhood is part of the San Francisco Peninsula’s denser east side.Credit...Jim McAuley for The New York TimesResearchers define extreme overcrowding as any home that is occupied by more than one person for every room without a toilet. By this measurement, overcrowding has increased nationwide since the mid-2000s, and the problem is particularly acute in California. About 13.4 percent of rental units — more than double the national average — were considered overcrowded in 2018, according to the Census Bureau. San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties, which roughly outline Silicon Valley, have one of the world’s densest concentrations of billionaires as well as some of the country’s most overcrowded homes.After the studio, Ms. Lorenzo found a $1,250-a-month room in her current home, a blue stucco house at the back of a two-unit lot, with chalk drawings on the driveway and a dirt yard in the back. There were 11 occupants after Ms. Lorenzo moved in, 12 after her younger child was born.Dividing the rent had benefits, like allowing Ms. Lorenzo to save money and buy her first television. The children’s shared mattress from the studio was replaced with a new bunk bed. “More clothes, more shoes for the children,” she said, “because we were limited in many things.”The catch was living with personalities, rules and understandings. Cooking privileges were on a first-come basis, which meant that the last family to use the kitchen might not eat until 9:30 p.m. There was no official time limit on the bathroom, but people knew to be fast. If anyone got a cold, everyone was exposed.Crowded homes have been a concern practically as long as public health has been a field. Living with a pile of roommates has long been associated with faster-spreading infections, inescapable stress, irregular sleep and the effects that follow, including higher blood pressure and weakened immune systems.But those take years to develop. The coronavirus spreads in days. By moving so fast and furiously, the virus has exposed in weeks something doctors have been worried about for generations, said Dr. Margot Kushel, an internist and director of the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at the University of California, San Francisco. “Covid has really become a story of essential workers living in crowded housing,” she said.Games in the ClosetImageSaving on rent by sharing a home meant Karla Lorenzo could spend more on her children’s needs. But it also brought tensions with other tenants, along with the health risks of overcrowding.Credit...Brian L. Frank for The New York TimesThe sickness began, as it does, with worry.In mid-April, after schools shut down and the children were sent home with worksheets, Abel returned from his job with a report that two of his co-workers had been out sick. He showered with the garden hose and slept in the car that night. But it was too late.His symptoms were initially mild, before escalating to a 104-degree fever and a shortness of breath that prompted Ms. Lorenzo to take him to the hospital. The county health department, worried that a crowded home would accelerate the spread of what was confirmed to be the coronavirus, dispatched a case worker to test everyone in the house, Ms. Lorenzo said. Eight — all except her children — were also positive.Ms. Lorenzo never got more than a headache and a sore throat, which in normal times would not have even prevented her from going to work. Suddenly she had to isolate herself in a house where everything was shared.She settled on the closet, running a phone charger under the door and sitting there for six to eight hours a day, playing word games on her phone, calling relatives in Guatemala, sometimes just napping. Her 10-year-old son took over cooking meals and changing diapers. All the while, Abel was in the hospital. Improving or worsening, alive or dead, Ms. Lorenzo had no idea.“There was no communication with him, so my head was spinning,” she said.ImageMs. Lorenzo's children were the only ones living at the house who avoided getting the coronavirus.Credit...Brian L. Frank for The New York TimesMs. Lorenzo sprayed down the bathroom whenever she or the children used it. She avoided the kitchen and had her sister, who lives more than a half-hour away in Oakland, deliver food through the bedroom window. One time, the sister brought a thermos of hot coffee that Ms. Lorenzo said might as well have been hot water; the virus had so ruined her sense of taste that she could not tell the difference.Still, the house got tense. One of the housemates accused Abel of infecting them. She told Ms. Lorenzo that if anyone in her family died, she would figure out a way to sue her. After that came the silent treatment — “no hablaba” — and as house relations plummeted, Ms. Lorenzo feared she would be evicted with nowhere to go.After two weeks, a county health worker returned to test the house again. Ms. Lorenzo’s children were still negative, which seemed so unlikely, given the crowding, that the county retested them several times. All negative, she said. Worried that this luck would soon run out, the county moved her and the children to an emergency trailer.They lived there for nine days, leaving only to collect stale salad and sandwiches left on an outdoor table. When they finally went home, Abel was back from the hospital.Days of deep cleaning ensued. Ms. Lorenzo, back to health, is wondering when the world will return to some semblance of normality. Yet she feels lucky that things are not worse, because she thought her partner was going to die. “We are trying to cope with it,” she said. “Trying to leave everything in the past.”Crowding vs. DensityImageChelsea, Mass., had one of the nation’s worst coronavirus outbreaks. “It’s not how many people you run into on the street but how many people you see when you come home,” an affordable-housing provider there said.Credit...Brian Snyder/ReutersEarly in the outbreak, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and some commentators blamed dense housing and public transit for the spread of the virus. The proof seemed as intuitive as New York’s status as an early epicenter. The recent surge of cases in the more sprawling metropolitan areas of the South and the West has undercut that thesis, and a number of new studies suggest that density, the number of housing units per acre, is less important than crowding, the number of people per bedroom.One widely cited report was from New York University’s Furman Center, which found that infections were much more intense in Queens neighborhoods with high rates of overcrowding than in Manhattan neighborhoods with higher density but fewer people per unit. The link between crowding and transmission has since shown up in suburbs, rural America and Native American reservations. There is even some evidence that dense metropolitan counties, while suffering higher raw numbers of infections, have a lower death rate because it is easier to get to a hospital.San Mateo County has been a bright spot, with a rate of about 700 coronavirus cases per 100,000, about half the rate of the state. Still, the county’s cases have been concentrated in low-income households, with most coming lately from front-line workers who “live in crowded multigenerational conditions,” according to the county health officer.In Chelsea, Mass., which had one of the nation’s worst outbreaks, there is a compelling suggestion that less-crowded quarters can help control the spread. Sleeved into the same blocks where buildings were overrun with infection are 375 subsidized apartments owned by The Neighborhood Developers, a housing nonprofit. The 968 tenants are mostly nonwhite, have the same mix of low-paid service jobs as their neighbors, and live in multistory buildings. But their units are subsidized and less crowded — and so far, healthier.The Neighborhood Developers has had eight reported cases of the coronavirus in Chelsea, or 826 per 100,000 people, about a tenth the rate of the surrounding community. “It’s not how many people you run into on the street but how many people you see when you come home,” said Rafael Mares, executive director of The Neighborhood Developers.The story is tempered by its rarity. The United States has a deficit of seven million apartments available to the lowest-income households, or an average of 36 available affordable units for every 100 extremely low-income families in search of one, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.In April of last year, The Neighborhood Developers opened a five-story building with 34 apartments for homeless and low-income families. It received 3,598 applications.Rent Is DueImageBefore the pandemic, Ms. Lorenzo’s sister used three red-and-white coolers to sell ice cream on the street. Now they are stacked against a wall, a reminder of lost income.Credit...Brian L. Frank for The New York TimesStacked against a wall in Ms. Lorenzo’s living room are three red-and-white coolers that her sister used to fill with ice cream to sell on the street. They are furloughed because of the lack of demand and have become just another obstacle that her cooped-up children have to dodge while zipping around the house.Abel still gets headaches and a tremor in his left arm, but the virus is gone and he is well enough to work. Ms. Lorenzo has not cleaned a house since March but recently got a new job cleaning offices. The family has also been relying on nonprofit organizations and Christian charities for staples.Once a week Ms. Lorenzo joins the procession of cars that roll through a parking-lot food bank set up by Samaritan House, a San Mateo-based organization that has seen demand for food double and is spending $200,000 a week on rental assistance. Since April 1, 4,000 families have applied for some $8 million in assistance on rent and utilities “and it hasn’t even really hit yet,” said Bart Charlow, Samaritan House’s chief executive.Ms. Lorenzo’s name could soon be on the list. In June, the departure of the angry housemates opened up an extra bedroom, and her family spread out, with the older children moving across the hall — the sort of arrangement that the San Mateo County Health Department has been recommending for years, except that it is financially unsustainable.After taking the extra bedroom, Ms. Lorenzo’s family’s share of the rent jumped to $2,100 from $1,250. Their savings got them through July. Now that money is gone, and August is here.Liliana Michelena and Ben Casselman contributed reporting."}]
